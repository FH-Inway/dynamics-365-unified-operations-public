This article describes how to build out the Microsoft Dynamics 365 Commerce Store Commerce mobile apps for Android and iOS with Hardware station extensibility.

As of the Dynamics 365 Commerce version 10.0.41 release, the Store Commerce app for Android supports Hardware station extensibility. iOS support for Hardware station extensibility is available starting with Commerce version 10.0.44. This functionality enables the following capabilities:
- Customers can build extensions to support their various Hardware station requirements.
- Organizations with fiscal integration requirements can use Android mobile devices with fiscal printers.
- Customers can create their own Android Application Package (APK) or iOS App Store Package (IPA) and distribute them through their respective app stores or internal channels.
  
## Prerequisites

To build out the Store Commerce app for Android or iOS with hardware station extensibility, you must first install the .NET Multi-platform App UI workload in Visual Studio 2022.
  
## Build out the Store Commerce app for Android or iOS using the Store Commerce mobile SDK

To build out the Store Commerce app for Android or iOS using the Store Commerce mobile software development kit (SDK), follow these steps.

1. Navigate to the [Microsoft Lifecycle Services Shared Asset Library](https://lcs.dynamics.com/V2/SharedAssetLibrary).
1. Under **Retail Self-service package**, download the latest Store Commerce for Android package (version 10.0.41 onwards for Android extensibility, version 10.0.44 onwards for iOS extensibility).
    > [!NOTE]
    > The **Store Commerce for Android package** includes both **Android and iOS dependencies**. There is no separate iOS package.
1. Unzip the Store Commerce for Android package, and then copy the `packages` folder to your repository root.
1. Next, you must modify the nuget.config file to include the `packages` folder as a package source. Under the `<packageSources>` node, add `<add key="Dynamics365Commerce-Mobile-Dependencies" value="./packages" />`.
1. Modify the app name displayed in the Android launcher or iOS home in the mobile app project by setting the `ApplicationTitle` value.
1. Modify the package name in the mobile app project by setting the `ApplicationId` value.
1. Build the mobile samples solution.

### Platform-specific configurations

#### Android
  - If an Android emulator is configured, you can start debugging the app directly from Visual Studio 2022.
  - If you don't want to develop an Android app, comment out the net8.0-android target framework ('<TargetFramework>net8.0-android</TargetFramework>') in the mobile app project.

#### iOS
  - If you are developing on Windows, you must pair a Mac for iOS development as described in [Pair to Mac for iOS development](https://learn.microsoft.com/dotnet/maui/ios/pair-to-mac).
  - If you don't want to develop an iOS app, comment out the net8.0-ios target framework ('<TargetFramework>net8.0-ios</TargetFramework>') in the mobile app project.
