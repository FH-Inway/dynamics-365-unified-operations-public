[!include [banner](../includes/banner.md)]

This article lists features that are either new or changed in Microsoft Dynamics 365 Commerce preview version 10.0.45. This version has a build number of 10.0.2345 and is available on the following schedule:

- **Preview of release:** July 2025
- **General availability of release (self-update):** September 2025
- **General availability of release (auto-update):** October 2025

## Features included in this release

The following table lists the features that are included in this release. We might update this article to include features that were added to the build after this article was originally published.

| Feature area | Feature | More information | Enabled by |
|---|---|---|---|
| Point of sale  | Store Commerce offline in iOS and Android Public Preview  | This release introduces offline capabilities for Store Commerce on iOS and Android devices. You can now use Store Commerce on these platforms even when offline, ensuring seamless operations and reliable business continuity. Key features include support for SQLite-based offline capabilities, a new SDK experience for iOS that enables extensibility in the app and database, database upgrade support, and an enhanced offline registration form. |  admins |
| Point of sale  | Funds available in external gift cards post-payments  | By default, the balance on gift cards is added immediately when a cashier issues a gift card or loads funds onto itâ€”**before** the customer completes payment which increases the business risk until the customer completes the payment. Starting with version **10.0.45**, a new feature is available that **delays the balance addition** until **after payment is successfully received**. Thus, reducing operational risk and improving reliability. Learn more: [External gift cards](../dev-itpro/gift-card.md)  |  admins |

### Removed and deprecated Commerce features

The [Removed or deprecated features in Dynamics 365 Commerce](removed-deprecated-features-commerce.md) article describes features that are removed or deprecated for Commerce.

- A *removed* feature is no longer available in the product.
- A *deprecated* feature isn't in active development and may be removed in a future update.

Before any feature is removed from the product, the deprecation notice is announced in the [Removed or deprecated features in Dynamics 365 Commerce](removed-deprecated-features-commerce.md) article 12 months before removal.

For breaking changes that only affect compilation time, but are binary compatible with sandbox and production environments, the deprecation time is less than 12 months. Typically, these changes are functional updates that need to be made to the compiler.
