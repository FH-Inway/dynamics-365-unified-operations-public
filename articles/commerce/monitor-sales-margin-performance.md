# Monitor sales and margin performance

[!include [banner](includes/banner.md)]

You can monitor sales and margin performance in real time using Dynamics 365 Commerce.

As part of Commerce, users can monitor sales and margin performance in real time across different levels of the organization hierarchy for the following dimensions:

- Products
- Categories
- Discounts
- Years as time period
- Registers/terminals
- Staff/employees
- Customers
- Operating units

Additionally, two unique reports that take advantage of hierarchical grid structuring let users monitor sales and margin performance by drilling down from the top category node to individual leaf nodes of the category in the default product category hierarchy. Users can also drill-down from the top operating unit to an individual channel in the organization hierarchy that is defined as the default organization hierarchy for reporting. You can open the reports from any of the following locations:

- **Store management** workspace &gt; **Retail and Commerce** &gt; **Channels** &gt; **Store management** &gt; **Reports**
- **Category and product management** workspace &gt; **Retail and Commerce** &gt; **Product and categories** &gt; **Store management** &gt; **Reports**
- **Pricing and discount management** workspace &gt; **Retail and Commerce** &gt; **Pricing and discounts** &gt; **Store management** &gt; **Reports**
- **Inquiries and reports** section &gt; **Retail and Commerce** &gt; **Inquiries and reports** &gt; **Sales reports**
