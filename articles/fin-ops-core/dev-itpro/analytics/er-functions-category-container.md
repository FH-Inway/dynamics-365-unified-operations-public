# List of ER functions in the container category

[!include [banner](../includes/banner.md)]

[Electronic reporting (ER)](general-electronic-reporting.md) container [functions](er-formula-language.md#Functions) can be used to perform operations that involve data sources of the *Container* data type. These operations occur when the processing data represents a collection of binary data in binary large object (BLOB) format. This article provides a summary of these functions.

## List of supported functions

| Function | Description |
|----------|-------------|
| [Base64StringToContainer](er-functions-container-base64stringtocontainer.md) | This function returns a *Container* value that consists of binary content that is decoded from the specified ASCII string that represents a Base64 group of binary-to-text encoding schemes. |
