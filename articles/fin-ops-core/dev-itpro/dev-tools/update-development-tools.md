# Update the Visual Studio development tools

[!include [banner](../includes/banner.md)]

This article explains how to update the development tools.

Use this tutorial to update your Visual Studio development tools with a new version. It explains how to uninstall your existing Visual Studio development tools and install the new extension. The new extension is in the form of an installable VSIX file. This file is a part of the binary hotfix available on the Dynamics 365 Lifecycle Services site. The VSIX file is located in the **DevToolsService\\Scripts** folder of the binary hotfix package.

While working in Visual Studio, you might receive recurring feedback requests regarding new features.

To prevent the feedback requests from appearing in Visual Studio, run the following PowerShell command from a developerâ€™s machine:

```powershell
Set-ItemProperty HKCU:\Software\Microsoft\Dynamics\AX7\Development\Configurations  -Name ProvideFeedback  -Value "No"
```
