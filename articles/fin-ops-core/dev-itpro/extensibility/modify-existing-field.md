# Modify existing fields in a table through extension

[!include [banner](../includes/banner.md)]

To modify properties on an existing field in a table, you must first create an extension for the table. You can modify the following properties:

- **Label**
- **Help text**
- **Country Region Codes**
- **Extended Data Type** â€“ You can select only extended data types (EDTs) that are derived from the currently selected EDT. The lookup in the property sheet is filtered so that only those EDTs are shown. For example, to edit the EDT on the **Width** field in the InventTable table, you can create a derived EDT that is based on **BOMMeasureWidth**, and then modify the **Extended Data Type** property on the **Width** field in the **InventTable** extension. In this way, you can modify the look and feel of the **Width** field in the user interface when the new package is deployed.
