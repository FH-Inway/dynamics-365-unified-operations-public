# Terms and conditions for add-ins to Microsoft Dynamics 365 finance and operations apps

[!include[banner](../../../finance/includes/banner.md)]

Add-ins are features of Microsoft Dynamics 365 finance and operations apps. Use of finance and operations and related add-ins that are generally available are governed by the terms and conditions of the agreement under which you obtained this service.

When you purchase through a volume licensing agreement, such as an Enterprise Agreement, your use is governed by the volume licensing agreement under which you purchased the services. The licensing agreement incorporates the [Online Services Terms](https://www.microsoftvolumelicensing.com/DocumentSearch.aspx?Mode=3&DocumentTypeId=46). You can obtain a copy of your volume licensing agreement by contacting your Microsoft account representative or volume licensing.

If you are uncertain or have other questions, please contact [Microsoft Dynamics support](https://dynamics.microsoft.com/support/).

**Preview Supplemental Terms** - The [Preview Supplemental Terms](../../fin-ops/get-started/public-preview-terms.md) includes the legal terms that apply to your use of add-ins that are in beta, preview, or otherwise not yet released into general availability.
