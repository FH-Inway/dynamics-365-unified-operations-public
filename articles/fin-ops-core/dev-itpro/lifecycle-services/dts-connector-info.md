# Dynamics 365 Translation Service Connector

The Microsoft Dynamics 365 Translation Service Connector integrates with Microsoft Power Platform. Therefore, you can access Dynamics Translation Service (DTS) directly from a flow or app. This connector calls the DTS API on your behalf, saving you a trip to the website.

The following functionality is supported:

- Translate user interface (UI) files.
- Regenerate translation requests.
- Create translation memory (TM) files.

Documentation is available at [Dynamics Translation Service](/connectors/dynamicstranslations).
