If you use the Power BI app on telemetry data, it's easy to track the metrics that are important to you. 

With metrics in Power BI, you can curate your own metrics and track them against key business objectives, in a single pane. This feature enhances data culture by promoting accountability, alignment, and visibility for teams and initiatives within organizations.

Follow this four-step process to set up alerting with Power BI Metrics:

1. Create a scorecard in the Power BI service. See [Create scorecards in Power BI](/power-bi/create-reports/service-goals-create).
2. Add the _metrics_ you want to track by connecting to your Power BI report on telemetry. See [Create connected metrics](/power-bi/create-reports/service-goals-create-connected).
3. Add alerting by defining status rules for your metrics as it automates status updates based on rules that govern that metric. Rules trigger changes based on value, percentage of target met, date conditions, or a combination of the three, making the rules as versatile as possible. For connected metrics, these status rules are refreshed every time the data in your scorecard is refreshed. For more information, see [Create automated status rules for metrics](/power-bi/create-reports/service-metrics-status-rules).
4. Follow metrics to get alerts in Teams or by email. See [Follow your metrics](/power-bi/create-reports/service-metrics-follow).
