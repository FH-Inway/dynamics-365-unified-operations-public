If you use the Power BI app on telemetry data, it's easy to track the metrics that are important to you.

With metrics in Power BI, you can curate your own metrics and track them against key business objectives in a single pane. This feature enhances data culture by promoting accountability, alignment, and visibility for teams and initiatives within organizations.

Follow this four-step process to set up alerting with Power BI Metrics.

1. Create a scorecard in the Power BI service. Learn more in [Create scorecards and manual metrics in Power BI](/power-bi/create-reports/service-goals-create).
2. Add the _metrics_ that you want to track by connecting to your Power BI report on telemetry. Learn more in [Create connected goals in Power BI](/power-bi/create-reports/service-goals-create-connected).
3. Add alerting by defining status rules for your metrics. Statuses are then automatically updated based on the rules that govern each metric. Because the rules trigger changes based on the value, the percentage of the target that was met, date conditions, or a combination of the three, they are very versatile. For connected metrics, the status rules are refreshed every time the data on the scorecard is updated.

4. Follow metrics to get alerts in Teams or by email. Learn more in [Follow your metrics](/power-bi/create-reports/service-metrics-follow).
