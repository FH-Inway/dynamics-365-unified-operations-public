This article demonstrates how to create a record template so that field values that are used often do not have to be entered explicitly for each new record. In this procedure, you'll create a new record for new laptops that should be added to your fixed assets. This procedure uses the USMF sample company.

1. In the navigation pane, go to **Modules > Fixed assets > Fixed assets > Fixed assets**.
2. Select **New**.
3. In the **Fixed asset group** field, enter or select a value.
4. In the **Name** field, type a value. For example, enter **Corporate lead laptop**.  
5. In the **Search name** field, type a value. For example, enter **laptop**.  
6. Expand the **Technical information** section.
7. In the **Make**, **Model**, and **Model year** fields, type values.
8. On the Action Pane, select **Options**.
9. Select **Record info**.
10. Select **User template**.
11. In the **Name** field, type a value.
12. In the **Description** field, type a value.
13. Select **OK**.
14. Select **Close**.
