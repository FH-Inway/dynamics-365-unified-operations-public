# Importing vouchers by using the General journal entity

[!include [banner](../../../finance/includes/banner.md)]

This article provides tips for importing data into the General journal by using the General journal entity. Find technical information about the entity at [General journal entity](../../dev-itpro/data-entities/entity-general-journal.md).

You can use the General journal entity to import vouchers that have an account or offset account type of **Ledger**, **Customer**, **Vendor**, or **Bank**. The voucher can be entered as one line, using both the **Account** field and the **Offset account** field, or as a multi-line voucher, where only the **Account** field is used (and the **Offset account** is left blank on each line). The General journal entity doesn't support every account type. Instead, other entities exist for scenarios where different combinations of account types are required. For example, to import a project transaction, use the Project expense journal entity. Each entity is designed to support specific scenarios. This means other fields might be available in entities for those scenarios. However, other fields might not be available in entities for different scenarios.

**Understanding the Data Management Framework and OData Entities for General journal imports**

In the realm of data management, the choices between different frameworks and entities can significantly impact the efficiency and integrity of data handling processes. Two notable entities in this context are the Data Management Framework (DMF) entity and the OData entity, particularly the **LedgerJournalLineEntity**. Each of these entities has its unique advantages and limitations, and understanding these can help organizations make informed decisions about optimizing their data import processes. 

**Data Management Framework (DMF) Entity** 

The DMF entity is primarily designed for scenarios that require handling high-volume imports. Its optimization for such tasks makes it an invaluable tool for organizations dealing with large datasets. However, this entity is not without its limitations. 

**Advantages of DMF Entity** 

- High-Volume Import Handling: The DMF entity excels in scenarios where large volumes of data need to be imported efficiently. Its design focuses on optimizing bulk data movements, making it suitable for operations where time and performance are critical. 

- Configurability: Users can configure the DMF entity to suit their specific needs. For instance, by adjusting the data entity settings, users can emulate row-by-row validation and defaulting logic, aligning its performance characteristics with those of the OData entity. 

**Limitations of DMF Entity**

- Lack of Support for Intercompany Transactions: One of the primary limitations of the DMF entity is its inability to handle intercompany transactions effectively. This can be a significant drawback for organizations that operate across multiple legal entities and need to manage intercompany data seamlessly. 

- Minimal Validation During Import: The DMF entity performs minimal validation during the import process. This can lead to data integrity issues if not managed carefully, as errors or inconsistencies in the imported data may not be caught promptly. For example, the voucher is not defaulted. 

**OData Entity** 

- The OData entity, and specifically the LedgerJournalLineEntity, takes a different approach to data import and validation. It is built to invoke more comprehensive defaulting and validation -logic on a row-by-row basis, enhancing data integrity but potentially impacting performance. 

**Advantages of OData Entity** 

- Enhanced Data Integrity: The OData entity's row-by-row validation ensures that each entry is thoroughly checked before being imported. This comprehensive validation process helps maintain high data quality and consistency. 

- Defaulting Logic: The OData entity invokes defaulting logic for each row, ensuring that all necessary fields are populated correctly. This reduces the likelihood of incomplete or incorrect data entries. 

**Limitations of OData Entity** 

- Performance Impact: The additional processing required for row-by-row defaulting and validation can lead to slower performance. This is a trade-off that organizations need to consider, especially when dealing with large datasets.

**Balancing Performance and Data Accuracy** 

Organizations often need to strike a balance between performance and data accuracy. The flexibility offered by the DMF entity allows users to configure it to emulate the validation and defaulting logic of the OData entity. By turning off the set-based import configuration, the DMF entity can achieve functional parity with the OData entity while aligning its performance characteristics accordingly. 

**Performance Guidelines and Characteristics** 

When configuring data entities for import processes, it is crucial to consider performance guidelines and characteristics. These include row limit thresholds, which help optimize import processes and ensure system performance remains stable while handling large volumes of data. Proper configuration and adherence to these guidelines can enhance both the efficiency and effectiveness of data imports. 

**Conclusion** 

Both the DMF and OData entities offer unique benefits and challenges. The DMF entity's strength lies in its ability to handle high-volume imports, while the OData entity excels in ensuring data integrity through comprehensive validation. By understanding these entities' capabilities and limitations, organizations can make informed decisions that balance performance and data accuracy, optimizing their data import processes for maximum efficiency and reliability. 
This in-depth understanding of the Data Management Framework and OData entities will guide organizations in choosing the right approach for their specific data management needs, ensuring both performance and data integrity are achieved effectively. 

## Setup

Before you import by using the General journal entity, validate the following setup:

**Number sequence setup for the journal batch number**

- By default, when you import using the General journal entity, the journal batch number uses the number sequence that is defined in the General ledger parameters.
- If you set the number sequence for the journal batch number to **Manual**, a default number isn't applied. This setup isn't supported.

**Financial dimension configuration**

- Every organization must define the order of financial dimensions when entities are used to import transactions.
- The order for the **Ledger dimensions integration** format:
  - **General ledger** > **Chart of accounts** > **Dimensions** > **Financial dimension configuration for integrating applications** > **Select data entities**.
- The segments of the ledger account that is imported must have the same order. Otherwise, an error occurs during import.

## General journal entity setup

Two settings in Data management affect how the default journal batch number or voucher number is applied:

- **Set-based processing** (on the data entity)
- **Auto-generated** (on the field mapping)

The following sections describe the effect of these settings and explain how the system generates batch numbers for journals and voucher numbers.

### Journal batch number

- The **Set-based processing** setting on the General journal entity doesn't affect the way that journal batch numbers are generated.
- If the **Journal batch number** field is set to **Auto-generated**, a new journal batch number is created for every line that is imported. This behavior isn't recommended. The **Auto-generated** setting is found on the import project, under **View map**, on the **Mapping details** tab.
- If the **Journal batch number** field isn't set to **Auto-generated**, the journal batch number is created as follows:

  - If the journal batch number that is defined in the imported file matches an existing, unposted daily journal, all lines that have a matching journal batch number are imported into the existing journal. Lines are never imported into a posted journal batch number. Instead, a new number is created.
  - If the journal batch number that is defined in the imported file doesn't match an existing, unposted daily journal, all lines that have the same journal batch number are grouped under a new journal. For example, all lines that have a journal batch number of 1 are imported into a new journal, and all lines that have a journal batch number of 2 are imported into a second new journal. The journal batch number is created by using the number sequence that is defined in the General ledger parameters.

### Voucher number

- When you use the **Set-based processing** setting on the General journal entity, the voucher number must be provided in the imported file. Every transaction in the General journal is assigned the voucher number that is provided in the imported file, even if the voucher isnâ€™t balanced. Note the following points if you want to use set-based processing, but you also want to use the number sequence that is defined for voucher numbers.

  - To enable this functionality, on the journal name that is used for imports, set **Number allocation at posting** to **Yes**.
  - A voucher number must still be defined in the imported file. However, when the journal is posted, it overwrites the temporary number with the voucher number. Be sure that you group the lines of the journal correctly by the temporary voucher number. For example, during posting, three lines are found that have a temporary voucher number of 1. The next number in the number sequence overwrites the temporary voucher number of all three lines. If those three lines arenâ€™t a balanced entry, the voucher isn't posted. Next, if lines have a temporary voucher number of 2, the system overwrites this number with the next voucher number in the sequence.

- When you don't use the **Set-based processing** setting, you don't need to provide a voucher number in the imported file. The voucher numbers are created during import, based on the setup of the journal name (**One voucher only**, **In connection of balance**, and so on). For example, if the journal name is defined as **In connection of balance**, the first line receives a new default voucher number. The system then evaluates the line to determine whether the debits equal the credits. If an offset account exists on the line, the next line that is imported receives a new voucher number. If no offset account exists, the system evaluates whether the debits equal the credits as each new line is imported.
- If the **Voucher number** field is set to **Auto-generated**, the import fails. The **Auto-generated** setting for the **Voucher number** field isn't supported.

By default, the General journal entity uses set-based processing. After you evaluate the business requirements for your organization, you can change the **Set-based processing** setting by selecting **Data entities** in the **Data management** workspace. Set-based processing is used to speed up the import process. If you don't use set-based processing, import of the General journal entity import is slower.
