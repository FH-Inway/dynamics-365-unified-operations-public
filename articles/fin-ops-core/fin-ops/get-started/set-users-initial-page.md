1. Select **User options**.
1. Select the **Preferences** tab.
1. In the **Initial page** field, select an option from the drop-down list.
1. Select **Save**.

To set your own intial page (as a user), follow these steps.:

1. Open the **Settings** menu (gear icon) in the top navigation bar.
1. Select **User options**.
1. Select the **Preferences** tab.
1. In the **Initial page** field, select an option from the drop-down list.
