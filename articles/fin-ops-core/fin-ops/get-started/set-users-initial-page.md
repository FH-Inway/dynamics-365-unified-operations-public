# Set the preferred initial page for each user

[!include [banner](../includes/banner.md)]

This article explains how to set the initial page shown to a user when they open the application. The initial page can be different for each user. Each user can choose their own initial page at any time, and admins can set the initial page for any user.

By default the initial page is set to the [default dashboard](default-dashboard.md).

To set the initial page for another user (as system administrator), follow these steps:

1. Go to **System administration** \> **Users** \> **Users**.
1. In the list, find and select the user you want to set up.
1. On the Action Pane, select **User options**.
1. Open the **Preferences** tab.
1. On the **Startup** FastTab, set the **Initial page** field to your preferred initial page.
1. Select **Save**.

To set your own initial page (as a user), follow these steps:

1. Open the **Settings** menu (gear icon) in the top navigation bar.
1. Select **User options**.
1. Open the **Preferences** tab.
1. On the **Startup** FastTab, set the **Initial page** field to your preferred initial page.
1. Select **Save**.
