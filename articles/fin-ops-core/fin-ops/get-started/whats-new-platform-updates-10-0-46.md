### Removed and deprecated platform features

The [Removed or deprecated platform features](../../fin-ops/get-started/removed-deprecated-features-platform-updates.md) article describes features that are removed or planned for removal in platform updates for finance and operations apps.

- A *removed* feature isn't available in the product.
- A *deprecated* feature isn't in active development and might be removed in a future update.

Deprecation notices appear in the [Removed or deprecated platform features](../../fin-ops/get-started/removed-deprecated-features-platform-updates.md) article 12 months before any feature is removed.

For breaking changes that affect only compilation time, but are binary-compatible with sandbox and production environments, the deprecation time is less than 12 months. These changes are functional updates that must be made to the compiler.
