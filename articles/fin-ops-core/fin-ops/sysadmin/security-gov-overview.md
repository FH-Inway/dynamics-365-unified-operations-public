# User security governance overview

[!include [banner](../../../finance/includes/banner.md)]

User security governance helps organizations create a security architecture that is closely aligned with their business processes. It empowers organizations to apply precise role management, advanced audit capabilities, and comprehensive license optimization tools.

User security governance provides the following capabilities:

- Detailed reporting about segregation of duties and separation of privileges
- Process-based security roles, duties, and/or privileges
- Creation of new roles/duties from existing objects through import processes
- Temporary role capabilities
- Privileged user management, which enables dedicated accounts to gain time-bound access

## User security governance features

User security governance provides the following functionality:

- Design process-based security roles, duties, and/or privileges. Learn more in [Set up a process hierarchy, roles, and privileges](setup-process-role-hierarchy.md).
- Design position/responsibility-based user roles.
- Create new roles/duties from existing objects through import processes, and merge duties.
- Automate temporary role assignments. Learn more in [Temporary role management](temp-role-mgmt.md).
- Grant time-bound elevated privileges to dedicated accounts through privileged user management. Learn more in [Privileged user management](priv-user-mgmt.md).
- Continuously monitor segregation of duties and separation of privileges. Define a threshold, and control the creation of duties/privileges that have overlapping entry points. Learn more in [Roles violating segregation of duties](roles-violating-sod.md).
- Draft and eventually convert defined roles to an Application Object Tree (AOT) project.
- Use the user aging report.
- Manage versions of roles, duties, and privileges. Learn more in [Security version management](security-version.md).
    - Compare versions.
    - Restore previous versions.

- Use the duty subtraction function.
- Export the security configuration to XML. Learn more in [Security category export/import](security-category-import.md).
- Use the security audit trail to track changes that are made in user security governance. Learn more in [Set up security governance parameters](setup-security-gov-para.md).
- Use new reports that include license indicators by role, duty, privilege, and entry point. Learn more in [Available reports for security](security-reports.md).
