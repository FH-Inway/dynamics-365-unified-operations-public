The **User activity aging** report facilitates tracking login information into Dynamics 365 finance and operations, enabling administrators to monitor user activity effectively. 
Some of the most common monitoring days are 10, 30, 60, 90, 120. This data can be used to optimize licensing costs. These day ranges are configurable and can be customized to suit the organization's needs.

In order to define and customize time ranges for **User activity aging**, follow these steps:
1. Go to **System administration** > **Security governance setup** > **Parameters**.
2. On the **User aging periods** tab.
3. Configure all five periods as needed.
4. Click **Save**.
