# Extend Business performance analytics

You can integrate external facts and dimensions into the Business performance analytics data model to enhance the existing analytical capabilities. However, if there is a strict star schema structure, it's essential that you preserve the integrity of the model while you enable the new data.

This article suggests approaches that you can use to integrate new data into the Business performance analytics model. It focuses on extending existing tables or creating new tables while also maintaining relationships to the Business performance analytics model.

The approach that you use depends on the granularity of the external data, its relevance to existing business processes, and the need for new descriptive context. The key to effective integration of external data is maintaining conformance and clarity while avoiding unnecessary complexity.

## Extend existing dimension tables

This approach involves adding new attributes to existing dimension tables. It's suitable when the external data provides additional descriptive information about entities that are already captured in the current model.

### External data provides a new description about an existing entity

If the external data provides new descriptive information about an existing entity (for example, new customer demographics or additional product attributes), follow these steps.

1. **Identify the dimension.** Find the relevant dimension where the external data fits (for example, `CustomerDim` or `ProductDim`).
2. **Add new attributes.** Add new columns to the dimension table to hold the external data attributes. For example, add the `CustomerIncomeLevel` column to the `CustomerDim` table or the `ProductCategory` column to the `ProductDim` table.
3. **Ensure grain conformance.** Confirm that the new attributes maintain the existing grain of the dimension table. For example, if the grain is one row per customer, ensure that the new attributes apply to the customer as a whole, not at a lower level of granularity.
4. **No changes to fact tables are required.** Fact tables that reference the dimension automatically inherit the new attributes. Therefore, no changes to the fact table schema are required.

This approach has the following advantages:

- **Simplicity** – By extending dimensions, you avoid the need for additional tables. Therefore, the model is easier to maintain. 
- **Minimal impact on queries** – Because the fact table relationships aren't modified, existing queries remain intact. However, users gain access to the additional context that the new attributes provide.

This approach also has some disadvantages:

- **Granularity limitation** – This approach works only when the external data is aligned with the grain of the existing dimension. It doesn't work if the data is at a different level of detail.

## Add new dimensions

When the external data represents a new entity that doesn't fit into any existing dimension, you should introduce a new dimension table. The external data can then bring new descriptive information that enriches the analysis of fact tables.

### External data creates a new entity

If the external data introduces a new entity that isn't currently represented in the Business performance analytics model (for example, a marketing channel, geographic region, or organizational hierarchy), follow these steps.

1. **Create a new dimension table.** Build a new dimension table (for example, `ChannelDim`, `GeoDim`, or `DepartmentDim`) to hold the attributes that are related to the new entity.
2. **Generate a surrogate key.** Create a surrogate key (for example, `ChannelKey`, `GeoKey`, or `DepartmentKey`) as the primary key of the new dimension table.
3. **Link to existing fact tables.** Modify the relevant fact tables (for example, `SalesFact` or `MarketingFact`) so that they include a foreign key that references the new dimension. In this way, the new dimension can be used in queries.
4. **Ensure conformance.** If the new dimension applies to multiple fact tables, ensure that the foreign key is consistently used across all relevant fact tables and follows conformance rules.

This approach has the following advantages:

- **New context for analysis** – New dimensions add fresh descriptive power to the model. Therefore, they enable additional slicing of fact data.
- **Conformed dimensions** – If the new dimension is used across multiple fact tables, it enhances analytical capabilities by providing a consistent dimension for drill-across reporting.

This approach also has some disadvantages:

- **Model complexity** – The addition of new dimensions increases the complexity of the data model, especially in terms of joins and query performance.
- **ETL complexity** – Modify the extraction, transformation, and loading (ETL) process to populate the new dimension table and ensure that it stays in sync with related fact data.

## Extend existing fact tables by adding measures

This approach is used when the external data includes additional metrics that are aligned with the grain of existing fact tables. The external facts are added as new columns (measures) to the existing fact table.

If the external data provides new facts or measures that are related to the same business process (for example, additional financial metrics such as discounts, taxes, or extended transaction details), follow these steps.

1. **Identify the fact table.** Identify the relevant fact tables (for example, `SalesFact` or `GeneralLedgerFact`) that are aligned with the external facts.
2. **Add new measure columns.** For each external fact, add new columns to the fact tables. For example, add the `DiscountAmount`, `TaxAmount`, or `PromotionAmount` column to the `SalesFact` table.
3. **Ensure granularity alignment.** Confirm that the new facts are at the same grain as the existing fact table. For example, if the fact table records individual transactions, the new measures must be at the transaction level.
4. **Adjust the ETL process.** Modify the ETL process to populate the new measure columns in the fact table during data loads.

This approach has the following advantages:

- **Efficient querying** – By adding new measures to existing fact tables, you maintain a streamlined schema that enables efficient queries without additional joins.
- **Minimal changes** – The structure of the model remains largely unchanged. The only change is the addition of new metrics.

This approach also has some disadvantages:

- **Fact table expansion** – The addition of too many measures can lead to very wide fact tables and might therefore affect performance.
- **Granularity limitation** – This approach works only when the external facts are aligned with the grain of the existing fact table. If the external data is at a different grain, you must consider other approaches.

## Add new fact tables

When the external data represents a new business process or transactions that aren't captured in the existing fact tables, you should create new fact tables to store the data. This approach ensures that the model remains clean, and that there are distinct fact tables for each business process.

If the external data introduces new facts that are related to a different business process (for example, marketing campaigns, inventory transactions, or supplier-related data), follow these steps.

1. **Design a new fact table.** Create a new fact table (for example, `MarketingFact` or `InventoryFact`) that stores the new facts. This fact table should follow the same principles as the existing Business performance analytics fact tables, including a clear grain and surrogate keys for dimensional relationships.
2. **Identify relevant foreign keys.** In the new fact table, add foreign keys that link to the existing dimensions (for example, `CustomerKey`, `ProductKey`, or `TimeKey`).
3. **Add new foreign keys (if they are needed).** If the external data introduces new dimensions (for example, a new `CampaignDim` dimension for marketing campaigns), add a foreign key for the new dimension in the fact table.
4. **Ensure conformance.** If the new fact table shares dimensions with existing fact tables, ensure that the conformed dimensions (for example, `TimeDim` or `CustomerDim`) are used consistently to support drill-across queries.

This approach has the following advantages:

- **Clear separation of business processes** – The creation of new fact tables ensures that different business processes are isolated. Therefore, this approach helps maintain clarity in the data model.
- **Optimized performance** – Queries against the fact tables are optimized, because each table handles only one business process.
- **Granularity control** – You can ensure that the new fact table has the appropriate grain for the new business process, without the limitations of existing fact tables.

This approach also has some disadvantages:

- **Model expansion** – The introduction of new fact tables increases the complexity of the model and adds more tables that must be managed.
- **Additional ETL work** – The ETL process must be modified to handle data loads for the new fact tables. Therefore, this approach increases the maintenance effort.
