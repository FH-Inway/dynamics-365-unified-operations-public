# Business performance analytics FAQ

This article answers frequently asked questions about Business performance analytics.

### I received an error during the installation of Business performance analytics. How do I fix it?

The following errors are likely to occur if another operation is in progress during the installation of Business performance analytics. If these errors persist, retry the installation.

- "There's another \[RibbonMetadataGeneration\] running at this moment."
- "Issues with enabling change tracking: msdyn\_BpaTablesVirtualEntities."
- "Import failed - errorCode: 0Description: Unable to complete updates to the Track changes option for table."
- "Flight EnableSqlRowVersionChangeTracking isn't enabled. The functionality requires enabling sql row version change tracking feature. Enable flight EnableSqlRowVersionChangeTracking."

### How do I retry the installation of Business performance analytics if it fails?

1. Sign in to the [Power Platform admin center](https://admin.powerplatform.microsoft.com/) by using Microsoft Dataverse admin credentials.
2. Go to **Environments**, and select **Dynamics 365 Apps**.
3. Find **Business performance analytics**, and select **Installation failed**.
4. Select the link to retry the installation, and monitor the app installation process.

### I am having trouble opening Business performance analytics. What can I do? 
If you are accessing Business performance analytics from the maker portal, click **Play** in the top right corner to avoid viewing the app in editor mode.

### Why isn't my data showing up in Business performance analytics?

To maintain the accuracy of report data, Business performance analytics assesses the quality of the source data. If the assessments don't meet defined rules, Business performance analytics logs information in the **Bpa self help logs** table in Dataverse. To learn more, see [Business performance analytics self-help](/troubleshoot/dynamics-365/finance/business-performance-analytics/business-performance-analytics-self-help-overview).

Some customers might reach the storage capacity limits of their Power BI Embedded SKU. In this case, the Power BI dataset that they need for reports can't be updated. By default, Business performance analytics uses the A3 SKU for Power BI Embedded. We recommend that you scale up your SKU to raise your Power BI Embedded storage capacity. For more information, see [Capacity and SKUs in Power BI embedded analytics](/power-bi/developer/embedded/embedded-capacity).

### Why is Business performance analytics using a lot of managed data lake storage in Dataverse?

As part of the data pipeline for Business performance analytics, your data is transformed to fit our dimensional data model. This process creates files that are saved to the managed data lake. The data transformation process occurs every time Business performance analytics refreshes its data. It generates new files in the managed data lake without deleting the old, obsolete files. The old files are deleted in 30 days, or our team manually deletes them when Business performance analytics uses 50 percent or more of the managed data lake's storage capacity.

### What's the estimated time that's required to set up Business performance analytics?

The setup of the Business performance analytics app takes up to 60 minutes.

### When will data be available in reports after Business performance analytics is installed?

Data will be available 24 hours after installation is completed. The time that's required to load data depends on the data size.

### How many years of data are available on reports?

Business performance analytics has data for the current calendar year plus the previous three calendar years.

### After Business performance analytics is set up, how often is the data refreshed?

Data is refreshed twice per day, at 12:00:00 AM and 12:00:00 PM (Coordinated Universal Time). To view exactly when a report's data was last refreshed, open the report. Near the top of the page, the rightmost item shows when the data for the report was last refreshed.

### How long does it take for fresh data to be available every day on Business performance analytics reports?

The amount of time that's required depends on the volume of data. However, there should be fresh data every 24 hours.

### How do I uninstallâ€¯Business performance analytics?

Two options are available for uninstalling Business performance analytics: code-based uninstallation and manual uninstallation. If you must reinstall Business performance analytics after you uninstall it, wait four hours before reinstallation.

> [!NOTE]
> If you uninstall and then reinstall Business performance analytics, no new reports that were created are saved.

### Why does Data Lake storage consumption grow steadily while using Business performance analytics, and what solutions are being implemented to address this issue?
Some customers may observe that Data Lake storage consumption grows steadily more often than others due to operating on significant amounts of data, while others may never experience this issue. This happens because older Business performance analytics releases rely on staging-table references that block file deletion, causing multiple transform output files to accumulate over time. The Business performance analytics engineering team proactively checks for potential capacity concerns every two weeks and intervenes to remove old temporary files if usage approaches critical thresholds. Customers must open a support incident upon noticing storage constraints for more frequent manual cleanup by Microsoft engineers.

In the Business performance analytics January 2025 update, a routine is introduced which removes staging file dependencies and implements a 3-day retention policy to regularly clear older files. After upgrading to Business performance analytics version 2.0.29241185 or later, Microsoft enables the auto-cleanup flight in each environment, drastically reducing reliance on manual cleanup processes. 

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Customers affected by storage capacity growth after updating to Business performance analytics version 2.0.29241185 or later should contact support and request to enable the temporary files cleanup routine for their environment.

### Can BPA support multiple calendar configurations?
Yes, Business Performance Analytics (BPA) supports multiple calendar configurations, including fiscal calendars such as 4-4-5, 4-5-4, and other custom non-Gregorian structures.

BPAâ€™s semantic model includes a flexible date dimension (`Dim - Date (Accounting)`) with a `CalendarType` attribute that allows data to be analyzed according to a customer's preferred calendar setup. This design supports consistent financial and operational reporting across varying fiscal calendars.

> **Note:** Some native Power BI visualsâ€”like slicers with the *"Between"* styleâ€”only work with continuous Gregorian `DateTime` columns and may not reflect fiscal calendar logic. This is a limitation of the visual, not the data model.

#### Recommendations:
- Use **dropdown or list slicers** for fiscal periods, years, or weeks.
- Leverage the `CalendarType` filter to dynamically adjust time context in reports.
- Design visuals and DAX measures to respond to the selected calendar configuration.

This approach ensures BPA remains adaptable to your businessâ€™s timekeeping practices while maintaining modeling best practices and analytic clarity.
