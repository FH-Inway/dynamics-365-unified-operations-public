When used as a Software as a Service (SaaS) solution, Business performance analytics allows Dynamics 365 customers to quickly and efficiently leverage advanced analytics. It improves decision-making, operational efficiency, and drives better outcomes, all while avoiding the complexity of deep system integrations.

Key SaaS capabilities:

 - Commerce: Analyze sales performance, customer purchase patterns, and the impact of promotional campaigns.

## Data as a service (DaaS) solution with data warehousing
Business performance analytics can also be used as a DaaS solution. This allows organizations to integrate its data models with their existing data warehousing infrastructure in Microsoft Fabric. This approach maximizes the value of existing data solutions while positioning businesses for future enhancements.

### DaaS capabilities
Some DaaS capabilities include:
 - Unified and scalable data models: By adopting Business performance analytics data models, customers can build custom models on top of a unified framework, ensuring consistency and scalability across data sets.
 - Future proofing with automatic upgrades: The Business performance analytics data model integrates seamlessly with future Dynamics 365 updates, reducing manual maintenance and ensuring access to the latest features.
 - Consistency and standardization: Business performance analytics data models provide consistency and standardization across data sources, ensuring high data quality and integrity.
 - Advanced analytics and AI: Customizing Business performance analytics data models enables organizations to leverage advanced analytics and AI capabilities, deepening insights without needing to develop them from scratch.
 - Enhanced data governance: A unified Business performance analytics data model supports better data governance by providing standardized data definitions, relationships, and hierarchies, ensuring consistency and quality across the organization.

### DaaS use cases

Some example DaaS use cases include:
 - Financial services: Seamlessly integrate Business performance analytics data models to comply with financial regulations and ensure up-to-date reporting.
 - Retail: Customize inventory and sales analytics while benefiting from new features in Dynamics 365, minimizing the need for extensive rework.

## Included with Dynamics 365 Finance
Business performance analytics is a innovative reporting tool that comes as part of the Dynamics 365 Finance license. In addition to its comprehensive analytics capabilities, business performance analytics leverages shared Dataverse entitlements, including access to the data lake, allowing customers to seamlessly integrate and manage their data.

## Data reporting capacity
With business performance analytics, customers are currently entitled to report on up to eight quarters of data. The volume of data is also constrained by the storage capacity of the A3 Power SKU. If customers are unable to fit their data within the constraints of the Power BI A3 SKU, they should consider waiting for a future release when additional data reporting capacity is available. This future release expands the data limits, allowing for larger datasets to be reported and analyzed.

## Data refresh frequency
Business performance analytics allows for two data refreshes per day, 12 AM and 12 PM (International standard time). More frequent refreshes will be available in the future, ensuring that customers can work with the most up-to-date information for their reporting needs.
