### System requirements

A Tier-2 environment (multi-box) is required to preview business performance analytics. For more information about environments, see [Environment planning](../../fin-ops-core/fin-ops/imp-lifecycle/environment-planning.md).

### Version requirements

Business performance analytics requires Dynamics 365 Finance version 10.0.38 (Application version 10.0.1777.94) or later.

        1. In the Power Platform Admin Center, go to **Environments**.
        2. Select the relevant environment.
        3. In the **Access** section, select users.

2. Go to the details page of the implementation project that's used to manage the Dynamics 365 Finance environment.
3. Select **Full details** for the environment that you want to use for the setup.
4. Confirm that the Microsoft Power Platform Integration is shown. If Microsoft Power Platform has been set up, the name of the Microsoft Power Platform environment that's linked to the Dynamics 365 Finance environment will be listed and shows a status of **Power Platform environment setup is complete**. If Microsoft Power Platform hasn't yet been set up, select **Setup**, and follow the prompts as required.
