2. If only the **Move data across regions** setting is selected and not the **Bing search** setting, the Copilot sidecar may be visible in Business performance analytics but won't be able to respond to most prompts a user asks Copilot. 
3.	Confirm Copilot is set as **Default** or **On** for your environment in the Power Platform admin center. For more information, see [Add Copilot for app users in model-driven apps](/power-apps/maker/model-driven-apps/add-ai-copilot#enable-copilot-for-model-driven-apps-feature-for-your-environment).
4.	Confirm the Copilot control is set to **Default** or **On** for the Business performance app in the Maker portal. For more information, see [Add Copilot for app users in model-driven apps](/power-apps/maker/model-driven-apps/add-ai-copilot#disable-copilot-for-a-model-driven-app).

### Usage
After the generative help and guidance is turned on using the previous steps, generative help and guidance can be asked via the Copilot sidecar in Business performance analytics. 
 - Users can select a prompt from initial message in the chat, the prompt guide near the textbox at the bottom of the sidecar, or enter their own text prompts.
 - Copilot looks at Business performance analytics’ documentation on MS Learn, including this page, to form a response.
 - Prompts unrelated to Business performance analytics or those with severe spelling and grammar errors won’t get an answer. Instead, these prompts receive a default, fallback response instead. If a response is good or bad, users can choose to provide feedback using the thumbs up and down icons located on each response.
