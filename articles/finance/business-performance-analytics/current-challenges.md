# Business performance analytics troubleshooting

[!include [banner](../includes/banner.md)]

This article describes some known issues in Business performance analytics.

## Diagnostics page
The Business performance analytics admin has access to a diagnostics page that acts as a self-help tool to monitor their Business performance analytics data and app health. This page includes a message center where the admin receives proactive notifications when action is required to correct an error in their environment.

### View notifications from the diagnostics page
To view messages from the **Diagnostics** page, follow these steps:
1. Go to bell icon on the top right of the application.
2. Messages are displayed with a link to the diagnostics page.

### Access the Diagnostics page
You can access the diagnostic page from the **Administration** section of the app.

### View system status
The status section helps the admin troubleshoot if anything is misconfigured in their app. For example:
 - The status of their background flows
 - Are the app users set up correctly
 - Do the app admins have access to the required roles and settings

### View and complete messages
To view and complete messages, follow these steps:
1. On the **Diagnostics** page, the **Messages active** tab displays messages.
2. Expand the messages to view details. These are messages that require admin attention to mitigate any errors detected in the app.
3. After the action has been performed, mark the message as **Complete**. This confirms to telemetry that the action has been completed.
4. All completed messages are located on the **Completed** tab.

## Troubleshooting and maintenance reminders

### By default, the Order to cash data model isn't enabled for customers.

Customers must submit a request to Microsoft Support to have the *Order to cash* data model enabled. In the future, this model is automatically enabled for all customers.

### Custom reports are lost when Business performance analytics is uninstalled.

If Business performance analytics was uninstalled and then reinstalled, reports can be restored if the following conditions are met:

- A manual backup was completed. Alternatively, 24 hours have passed, so that the automated backup was completed.
- The Business performance analytics configuration solution (msdyn\_BpaConfigs) is still installed.
- No external issues are affecting the data lake.
- The reinstallation occurs in the same environment. Cross-environment restoration isn't supported.

To reinstall Business performance analytics and restore reports, follow these steps.

1. Before you uninstall Business performance analytics, confirm that a backup was completed.
2. Make sure that you don't uninstall the Business performance analytics configuration solution (msdyn\_BpaConfigs).
3. Reinstall Business performance analytics through the Microsoft Power Platform admin center.
4. After the installation is completed, do a restore.

To back up a report, follow these steps.

1. In [Power Apps](https://make.powerapps.com/), on the left navigation pane, select **Flows**.
2. Select **Play** to run the **Business performance analytics backup reports** flow.
3. Select **Run flow** in the pane that appears.

To do a self-service restore, follow these steps.

1. Run the **Business performance analytics restore reports** flow.
2. Select whether you want to restore all reports, only custom reports, or only the report that has a specific Financial Reporting Hub (FRH) report ID.
3. Select **Run flow** to begin the restoration process.

### Excel drill-down doesn't work when I analyze Business performance analytics data in Power Pivot.

Microsoft is investigating this issue, and a fix will be available in the future.

### Customers receive only two refreshes per day, at 12:00 AM and 12:00 PM (Coordinated Universal Time).

This limit will be removed in the future.

### The size of the data lake folder increases at each Business performance analytics refresh.

Customers might notice that the size of the data lake folder increases each time that Business performance analytics refreshes its data. This issue occurs because stale folders are cleaned only every 30 days. In the future, stale folders are cleaned more often.
