# Responsible AI FAQ for generative help and guidance in Business performance planning

## What is generative gelp and guidance?

Generative help and guidance is a Microsoft Copilot feature in Business performance planning. It provides a conversational interface where users can ask Copilot questions about the app. This feature is designed 
to assist new users in learning how to navigate the app and help experienced users stay updated on new features

## What sources does Copilot use to provide assistance?

The assistance provided by Copilot is based on Business performance planning public documentation available on Microsoft Learn. This documentation includes comprehensive details about the application, Business 
performance planning in general, Power BI visuals, the Excel add-in, and more.

## Is Generative help and guidance available globally?

Currently, Generative help and guidance is available in the United States in the English language.

## What should I do if the Copilot icon isn't visible in Business performance planning?
If the Copilot icon isn't visible, an administrator should check the following settings:
 - Confirm that consent was given to the terms of use for copilots and generative AI features in the Power Platform admin center.
 - Confirm that the **Move data across regions** checkbox is selected, and not just the **Bing search** checkbox.
 - Verify that the **Allow users to analyse data using an AI-powered chat experience in canvas and model-driven apps** field is set to either **Default** or **On** for your environment in the Power Platform admin
center.
 - Confirm that the **Copilot control** field is set to either **Default** or **On** for the Business performance app in the Maker portal.

## How can users interact with Copilot?
Users can interact with Copilot in several ways:
 - Selecting a prompt from the initial message in the chat.
 - Choosing a prompt from the prompt guide near the text box at the bottom of the sidecar.
 - Entering their own text prompt in the text box at the bottom of the sidecar

## What happens if a prompt is unrelated to Business performance planning?

Prompts that are unrelated to Business performance planning, or that have errors in spelling and grammar, don't receive an answer. Instead, they receive a default, fallback response.

## How can users provide feedback on Copilot's responses?
For each response, users can use the thumbs-up and thumbs-down icons to provide feedback about whether the response is good or bad.
