# Account reconciliation

This feature is available as of Microsoft Dynamics 365 Finance version 10.0.44. The feature can be used instead of the old reactive SSRS reports used for reconciling your general ledger with the subledgers of Accounts Payable, Accounts Receivable, Tax and Bank. The feature provides a workspace for viewing the reconciled data as well as automation that does the data analysis on a schedule you can define, allowing the processing to happen in the background and in off hours only if desired.  The exceptions shown on the workspace allow you to take action directly and when the Microsoft CoPilot powered agent is enabled it will provide suggestions to the most likely action to take, saving you time in the account reconciliation process each period end. 

## Account reconciliation workspace page

To access the Account reconciliation workspace navigate to Workspaces â€“ Account reconciliation. 

## Dealing with exceptions

If there are exceptions to address, click the mitigate exceptions button, to view all exceptions for all modules across all legal entities.  You can also navigate to the mitigate exceptions page by clicking on the red status button for a given module and a specific legal entity.
