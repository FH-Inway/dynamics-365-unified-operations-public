# Account reconciliation

This feature is available as of Microsoft Dynamics 365 Finance version 10.0.44. The feature can be used instead of the old reactive SSRS reports used for reconciling your general ledger with the subledgers of Accounts Payable, Accounts Receivable, Tax and Bank. The feature provides a workspace for viewing the reconciled data as well as automation that does the data analysis on a schedule you can define, allowing the processing to happen in the background and in off hours only if desired.  The exceptions shown on the workspace allow you to take action directly and when the Microsoft CoPilot powered agent is enabled it will provide suggestions to the most likely action to take, saving you time in the account reconciliation process each period end. 

## Account reconciliation workspace page

To access the Account reconciliation workspace navigate to Workspaces â€“ Account reconciliation.  This page will display any open exceptions for the current period, as well as any addressed exceptions and any automatically reconciled transactions in the summary cards near the top of the page.  Use the filter options at the top of the page to adjust the data you wish to view on the workspace, such as changing from the current fiscal period to the prior fiscal period.  

In the bottom section of the workspace page you will find details per each module and each company in that module that has transactional data for the period selected. 

## Dealing with exceptions

If there are exceptions to address, click the mitigate exceptions button found in the open exceptions card to view all exceptions for all modules across all legal entities.  You can also navigate to the mitigate exceptions page by clicking on the red status button for a given module and a specific legal entity.

## Snapshots

The last column of the main grid in the lower portion of the workspace page is to view a snapshot of data for the selected period, module and company combination.  The snapshot provides a final summary of all data for the given period including the automatically reconciled transactions and any addressed exceptions you might have dealt with for the period. 

## Configuration

Using the gear icon on the top right of the workspace page you can view the settings and configuaration for the account reconciliation feature. 

## Frequently asked questions

Q) The workspace does not show any data, what can I do?
- Verify the last time and next runtime at the top right portion of the workspace.  There will be an indication similar to: "Data last updated 30 minutes ago, next update in 1 hour".
- For testing purposes - you can adjust the frequency and next runtime in the process automation - background processes for the process named 'Automatic account reconciliation process'.  For production use, consider the impact of when and how frequently you want the process to execute and set the appropriate schedule.  
- Check the system batch job is waiting and not withold status in the batch jobs page. Look for the job named 'Process automation polling system job'.
