# Check for highly variable dimensions
In Dynamics 365 Finance, managing financial dimensions efficiently is crucial for maintaining performance during key processes like year-end close, trial balance reporting, and consolidation. Highly variable dimensions, those with a large number of distinct values, can significantly impact system performance. To address this, a feature was added in 10.0.45 that helps identify and monitor these dimensions. For more information on highly variable dimensions and how to avoid them see [Highly variable dimensions](/cost-accounting/high-var-dimensions.md).

## Purpose of the check
The system runs a process called LedgerDimensionUsageCountCheckAction to count how many distinct values each financial dimension has used in a fiscal year for each company. This helps users understand which dimensions might be causing performance issues and provides guidance for smoother financial operations.

## Enable the flights
Several feature flags enable this functionality with the default status disabled. To have these flights enabled submit a support ticket. The first two flights need to be enabled to do the dimension counts and the last three provide warning messages during the year-end close, trial balance report and consolidations. To see the warning messages all 5 flights need to be enabled. 
- LedgerDimensionUsageCountCheckFlight: Enables the daily check action.
- LedgerDimensionUsageCountScanFlight: Enables the monthly scan action.
- LedgerFiscalCloseHighlyVariableValidationFlight: Warns users during year-end close if highly variable dimensions are present.
- LedgerTrialBalanceHighlyVariableValidationFlight: Alerts users during trial balance reporting.
- LedgerConsolidateHighlyVariableValidateFlight: Displays warnings during consolidation if problematic dimensions are used.

## How the check works
1. When the LedgerDimensionUsageCountCheckFlight is enabled, you can view the status of highly variable dimensions in **General Ledger > Period Close > Year-end close**. Select **Dimension usage count check history** in the action pane.
2. The system periodically checks the number of distinct values for each dimension by ledger and fiscal year and can be viewed in the **Dimension usage count check history** page.
3. Dimensions are categorized based on thresholds:
   - Normal: less than 5,000 values
   - PossibleHigh: 5,000 values
   - High: 10,000 values
   - ExtremeHigh: 50,000 values
4. The check typically covers the most recent two fiscal years, including the current year.
5. These thresholds and parameters are configurable in the LedgerDimensionUsageCountParameters table.
6. Results are stored in two tables:
   - LedgerDimensionUsageCountCheckHistory: stores process metadata
   - LedgerDimensionUsageCount: stores counts and categories for each dimension
7. In the **Dimension usage count check history** page select **Run dimension usage count check** to run the check and **Delete dimension usage count check** to delete the check. 

## Scheduled Actions and Services
To keep the data up-to-date, this check runs several automated actions:
- LedgerDimensionUsageCountScanAction (monthly): Checks for new transactions and flags records for review.
- LedgerDimensionUsageCountCheckAction (daily): Executes checks on flagged records.
- LedgerDimensionUsageCountCheckTask: Runs the actual service to count dimension values, respecting a time limit (default: 1800 seconds). If the task exceeds this limit, it resumes the next day.
- LedgerDimensionUsageCountCheckService: Performs the query and stores results for dimensions exceeding thresholds.
