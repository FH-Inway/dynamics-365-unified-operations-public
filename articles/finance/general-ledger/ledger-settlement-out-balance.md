# Out of balance ledger settlements

[!include [banner](../includes/banner.md)]

If there are any out-of-balance ledger settlements, they will create an out-of-balance error when running the year-end close process. To address the out-of-balance error so the year-end close will process successfully, the user must manually review all ledger settlements in the target fiscal year.
