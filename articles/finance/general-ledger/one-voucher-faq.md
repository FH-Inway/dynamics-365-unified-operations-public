# One voucher FAQ

[!include [banner](../includes/banner.md)]

This article answers frequently asked questions about the One voucher functionality. One voucher for financial journals lets you enter multiple subledger transactions in the context of a single voucher. The journals that you can include in that voucher can be general journals, fixed asset journals, and vendor payment journals, among others.

## When will the One voucher functionality be deprecated?

Microsoft will not deprecate the existing One voucher functionality as it works in the current journal framework. As stated in the existing One voucher documentation, new features continue to be introduced to fill the functional gaps that exist today. 

For more information, see the [One voucher documentation](one-voucher.md).

## What does the solution that replaces One voucher look like?

Microsoft can't provide a specific solution, because each feature gap is different and must be evaluated based on the business requirements. Some functional gaps will likely be replaced with features that help meet specific business requirements. However, other gaps might be filled by continuing to allow for entry in a journal, as when One voucher is used, but enhancing the system to track more detail as required.

## Where can I track the progress of the feature gaps being filled?

As for every new feature, customers must watch the Release plan and "What's new or changed" documentation. Each feature is added to these documents, and a note indicates that the feature is required to meet a business requirement that previously required the One voucher functionality.

## When the deprecation date is identified, where will it be communicated?
The existing One voucher functionality won't be deprecated.
