4. In the list, find and select the desired record.

6. In the **Account** field enter an appropriate account based on the account type.
7. In the **Description** field, type a value.
8. Enter an amount for the account as either a **Debit** or **Credit**. 
9. In the **Offset account** field, enter an appropriate account based on the **Offset account** type.

## Validate transaction data integrity

Dynamics F&O easily allows you to validate the data integrity of a financial dimension associated with a particular transaction.

After navigating to **General ledger > Journal entries > General journals**, selecting the desired journal and clicking **Lines** from the action pane, right click the dimension combination in the account of interest. Then, select **Validate data integrity** from the drop down menu.

If data integrity errors are found, reset the dimension value by renaming it. For example, rename "Cust-01" to "Cust-01_rename", then rename it back to "Cust-01".

As this rename process may take a few minutes, check its status on the **Misc** tab of the **System administration > Periodic tasks > Data maintenance** module. There you should see the **Dimension value rename and modify chart of accounts delimiter process** data maintenance action.
