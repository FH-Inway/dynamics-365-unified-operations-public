## Features turned on by default in this release

The following table lists the features that are turned on by default in version 10.0.44. Most features that were turned on automatically can be turned off in [Feature management](../../fin-ops-core/fin-ops/
get-started/feature-management/feature-management-overview.md). In the future, some features that were turned on automatically might be removed from Feature management and become mandatory. This change ensures 
that customers are using current functionality, so that as enhancements are added, they can build on the current functionality. Features are never automatically enabled in less than one year, unless they're 
determined to be essential.
