# Electronic invoicing for Belgium

[!include [banner](../../includes/banner.md)]

This article provides information to help you get started with Electronic invoicing for Belgium. It explains how to configure the system so that you can use the last-mile connector to generate, submit, and receive electronic invoices in the [Pan-European Public Procurement Online (PEPPOL)](https://docs.peppol.eu/poacc/billing/3.0/) format in Microsoft Dynamics 365 Finance.

![Diagram that shows the e-invoice flow for Belgium.](../media/emea-bel-einoices-flow.jpg)

> [!NOTE]
> The electronic invoicing approach that this article describes is implemented by using an invoicing service that is applicable only to cloud deployments of Dynamics 365 Finance.

Watch the following overview of the Belgian electronic invoicing implementation in Finance.

> [!VIDEO d21698ae-599e-4895-9a45-e19226a852ab]

## Prerequisites

Before you begin the procedures in this article, the following prerequisites must be met:

- The company must be a registered taxpayer in Belgium.
- The company must have a signed agreement with the provider of electronic document delivery service that secures electronic document interchange in the **PEPPOL** format.
- Among the registered profile IDs, the company should have the **urn:fdc:peppol.eu:2017:poacc:billing:01:1.0** profile. Finance uses this profile for the interchange of documents in the **PEPPOL** format.
- The company must obtain, from the service provider, the required credentials to enable integration of the Electronic Invoicing service with the [Electronic Invoicing service independent software vendor (ISV) last-mile connector](../global/e-invoicing-isv-connector.md).

    > [!NOTE]
    > The current implementation assumes [Edicom](https://edicomgroup.com/electronic-invoicing) as the Electronic Invoicing ISV last-mile connection service provider. Learn more in [e-Invoicing Integration with Microsoft Dynamics 365](https://edicomgroup.com/edicom-microsoft?365).

- Become familiar with Electronic invoicing as it's described in [Electronic Invoicing service overview](../global/gs-e-invoicing-service-overview.md) and [Electronic invoicing components](../global/gs-e-invoicing-administration-integration-components.md).
- Do the common part of Electronic Invoicing service configuration as described in [Electronic invoicing components](../global/gs-e-invoicing-set-up-overview.md).

## Create the Azure Key Vault configuration

Create an Azure key vault to store the required secrets that are issued for your company. Learn more in [Configure Azure resources for Electronic invoicing](../global/gs-e-invoicing-set-up-azure-resources.md).

In the key vault, add the secret for the token that grants authorization to access the Edicom services. You must obtain this token from Edicom before you begin, as described in the prerequisites.

## Configure electronic invoicing Key Vault parameters

To configure electronic invoicing Key Vault parameters, follow these steps.

1. Go to **Organization administration** \> **Setup** \> **Electronic document parameters**.
1. On the **Electronic invoicing** tab, in the **Key Vault settings** section, in the **Key Vault** field, select the reference to the key vault that you created in the previous section of this article.
1. In the **SAS token secret** field, select the name of the storage account secret URL that must be used to authenticate access to the storage account.
1. Select **Key Vault parameters**.
1. <a id="Tok"></a>On the **Key Vault parameters** page, in the **Certificates** section, select **Add** to create a **token** element of the **Secret** type for the secret that is described in the previous section.

    > [!NOTE]
    > The value in the **Name** column should match the name of the secret that is described in the previous section.

## Import the electronic invoicing feature

1. Go to **Globalization Studio**, and select the **Electronic invoicing** tile. Then import the latest version (**5** or later) of the **Belgian electronic invoice (BE)** Globalization feature as described in [Import features from the repository](../global/gs-e-invoicing-import-feature-global-repository.md).
1. In the **Electronic reporting** workspace, on the **Reporting configurations** tile, make sure that the following Electronic reporting (ER) configurations were successfully imported when you imported the **Belgian electronic invoice (BE)** Globalization feature:

    - Invoice model
    - Invoice model mapping
    - PEPPOL Sales e-invoice
    - PEPPOL Sales e-credit note
    - PEPPOL Project e-invoice
    - PEPPOL Project e-credit note
    - Customer invoice context model
    - Response message model
    - Edicom Response Processing
    - Error log import Json

    > [!NOTE]
    > If the preceding ER configurations weren't imported for some reason, manually import them as described in [Import Electronic reporting (ER) configurations from Dataverse](../global/workspace/gsw-import-er-config-dataverse.md).

1. On the **Reporting configurations** tile, import the latest versions of the following ER configurations. These configurations are required for the receipt of incoming vendor invoices.

    - Vendor invoice import
    - Vendor invoice Mapping to destination
    - Import invoice context model

## Configure the electronic invoicing feature

Some of the parameters from the **Belgian electronic invoice (BE)** electronic invoicing feature are published with default values. Before you deploy the electronic invoicing feature to the service, review the default values, and update them as required, so that they better reflect your business operations.

To review and update the configuration of the **Belgian electronic invoice (BE)** electronic invoicing feature, follow these steps.

1. Go to **Globalization Studio**, and select the **Electronic invoicing** tile. Then import the **Belgian electronic invoice (BE)** Globalization feature as described in [Import features from the repository](../global/gs-e-invoicing-import-feature-global-repository.md).
1. Create a copy of the imported Globalization feature, and select your configuration provider for it, as described in [Create Globalization features](../global/gs-e-invoicing-create-new-globalization-feature.md).
1. On the **Versions** tab, verify that the **Draft** version is selected.
1. On the **Feature parameters** tab, specify values for the following connection and integration parameters. These parameters are required for interoperation with Edicom services.

    - **Service ID** – Enter the service ID (domain) number that you obtained from Edicom. This value is used for company identification.
    - **Group** – Enter the group code. This value is used for internal routing within the Edicom infrastructure.
    - **Destination** – Enter the destination, which you construct by concatenating the service ID number and the string **_EDIWIN**. For example, if the service ID number is **123456**, enter **123456_EDIWIN**.
    - **Token** – Select the name of the [token](#Tok) that you previously created.

    ![Screenshot that shows the parameters on the Feature parameters tab being configured for the Globalization feature for Belgium.](emea-bel-einoices-feature-parameters.jpg)
