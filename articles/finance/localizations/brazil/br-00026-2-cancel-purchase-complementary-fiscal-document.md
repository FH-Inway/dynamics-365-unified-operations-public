[!include [banner](../../includes/banner.md)]

This article describes how to cancel an incorrect purchase complementary fiscal document and provide a reason for the cancellation in Brazil with Microsoft Dynamics 365 Finance.

You can cancel an incorrect purchase complementary fiscal document and provide a reason for the cancellation. When you cancel a purchase complementary fiscal document, a purchase complementary fiscal document is created that has a negative price amount, an Imposto Sobre Circulação de Mercadorias e Serviços (ICMS) amount, or an Imposto Sobre Produtos Industrializados (IPI) amount. When you post the negative purchase complementary fiscal document, the original complementary fiscal document is marked as canceled, and all the ledger transactions and financial transactions are reversed. The original purchase complementary fiscal document is reported in the fiscal books as canceled. The negative purchase complementary fiscal document isn't reported in the fiscal books. 

The following procedure uses the BRMF demo company.
