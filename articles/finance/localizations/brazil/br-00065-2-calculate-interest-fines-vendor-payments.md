# Calculate interest and fines on vendor payments (Brazil)

[!include [banner](../../includes/banner.md)]

This article describes how to apply interest and fines on vendor payments that are delayed in Brazil with Microsoft Dynamics 365 Finance.

You can apply interest and fines on vendor payments that are delayed. The interest and fine amounts that apply to a payment can be calculated when you make a payment to a vendor. Before you calculate interest or fine codes for vendor payments, you must set up a list of bank holidays and national/regional holidays. A holiday date that is set up on the **Payment calendar** form is considered a nonworking day. If an invoice is due on a nonworking day, the due date is moved to the next working day in the calendar, and the interest and fines are calculated accordingly. 

The following procedure uses the BRMF demo company.
