[!include [banner](../../includes/banner.md)]

This article describes how to configure the fixed asset Program of Social Integration (PIS) and Contribution for the Financing of Social Security (COFINS) tax credit to be appropriated in installments in Brazil with Microsoft Dynamics 365 Finance.

When a legal entity purchases a fixed asset, the PIS and COFINS tax credit that is calculated on that transaction can be appropriated in a specific number of installments. For the correct calculation for this tax refund, the legal entity must present a specific fiscal book or report for the information in the Sistema Publico de Escrituração Digital (SPED) Escrituracao Fiscal Digital (EFD) contributions file to demonstrate correct appropriation of the PIS and COFINS tax credit amount. The control of credit that's appropriated in the tax assessment period is detailed in records F120 and F130 of SPED EFD contributions.
