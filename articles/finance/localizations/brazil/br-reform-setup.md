## Hint

- Reformed tax codes must be created and maintained exclusively within the tax feature of the Advanced Tax Calculation engine. (For example CBS, IBS)

- Do not attempt to add legacy tax codes from the legacy engine into the Advanced Tax Calculation tax feature in Globalization Studio. Legacy tax codes must continue to be maintained using the established procedures in the legacy engine, while reformed tax codes are managed only in the Advanced Tax Calculation engine.

- Any changes that affect reformed tax calculationâ€”such as adjustments to tax rates, modifications of tax types, or the inclusion of sales tax codes in sales tax groups or item sales tax groupsâ€”made in the legacy engine forms (Sales tax codes, Sales tax groups, Item sales tax groups) will not be applied during tax calculation.
