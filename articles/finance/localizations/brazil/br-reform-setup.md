### Complete and change status
After completing all configuration steps, such as tax codes, tax groups, item tax groups, and rules, change the status of current version from **Draft** to **Completed**.

1. On the Tax calculation feature form, highlight the current version
1. Select **Change status** button, then select **Complete** option

## Enable Advanced Tax Calculation
With all the configuration and setup completing, enable the created feature in Advanced tax calculation engine. 

The steps for enablement are as follows.

1. Go to Module **Tax -> Setup -> Tax configuration -> Tax calculation parameters**
1. Select **General** Page, then select **Advanced tax calculation** FastTab
1. Set **Enable advanced tax calculation** option to be **YES**
1. In the **Feature** group select **Name**, and then select the previously created feature with the completed version.
1. You are prompted to maintain the attributes for the new tax code created:
   - **Settlement period**
   - **Ledger posting group**
   - **Currency**
6. The **Business process** field is inactive.

## Hint

* Reformed tax codes must be created and maintained exclusively within the tax feature of the Advanced Tax Calculation engine. (For example CBS, IBS)

* Don't attempt to add legacy tax codes from the legacy engine into the Advanced Tax Calculation tax feature in Globalization Studio. Legacy tax codes must continue to be maintained using the established procedures in the legacy engine, while reformed tax codes are managed only in the Advanced Tax Calculation engine.

* Any changes that affect reformed tax calculationâ€”such as adjustments to tax rates, modifications of tax types, or the inclusion of sales tax codes in sales tax groups or item sales tax groupsâ€”made in the legacy engine forms (Sales tax codes, Sales tax groups, Item sales tax groups) won't be applied during tax calculation.

* **Settlement period** and **Leger posting group** needs to be modified in legacy tax module **Tax->Indirect tax-> Sales tax -> Sales tax codes**.
