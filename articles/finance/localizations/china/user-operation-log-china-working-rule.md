This article describes how to generate a user operation log for China in Microsoft Dynamics 365 Finance.

Based on the criteria that you specify, user operations are tracked and recorded in a log, including the type of operation, username, and time and date.

The following procedures demonstrate how to set up criteria for tracking bank account creation, create a bank account for demonstration purposes, and generate the user log. The database log must be set up before you can generate the user operation log. These procedures use the CNMF demo data.

## Set up the database log

To set up the database log, follow these steps.

1. In Dynamics 365 Finance, go to **System administration \> Setup \> Database log setup**.
1. Select **New**.
1. Select **Next**.
1. In the tree, expand **Bank**.
1. In the tree, select the **Bank\Bank accounts** checkbox. For this demonstration, we want to keep track of who creates bank accounts, but you may want to track other user actions.  
1. Select **Next**.
1. Select the **Track new transactions** checkbox.
1. Select the **Update** checkbox.
1. Select the **Delete** checkbox.

1. In the tree, expand **Bank**.
