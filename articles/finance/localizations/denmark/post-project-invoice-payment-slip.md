# Post a project invoice with a payment slip

[!include [banner](../../includes/banner.md)]

This article describes how to post a project invoice with a payment slip in a specified format in Denmark with Microsoft Dynamics 365 Finance. 

You can post a project invoice with a payment slip attachment in a specified format. The payment slip is printed with the creditor identification number and invoice number to identify the payment. This functionality is available for legal entities whose primary address is in Denmark.

Before you can complete this procedure, you must first set up a payment slip format and set up payment slips for customer invoices. This procedure was created using the demo data company DEMF.
