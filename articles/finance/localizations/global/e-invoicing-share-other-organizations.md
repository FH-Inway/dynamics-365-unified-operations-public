# Share Globalization features with other organizations

[!include [banner](../../includes/banner.md)]

Follow these steps to share a Globalization feature with an external organization.

1. Sign in to your Regulatory Configuration Service (RCS) account.
2. In the **Globalization feature** workspace, in the **Features** section, select the **Electronic invoicing** tile.
3. On the **Electronic invoicing features** page, select the feature and version to share. You can't share feature versions that have a status of **Draft**.
4. On the **Organizations** tab, select **Share with**, and then, in the drop-down dialog box, enter the domain name of the organization that you want to share the feature with.
5. Select **Share**.

The feature is shared with the selected organization and becomes available for that organization in the Global repository. From there, the feature can be imported into the organization's RCS instance and used.
