# Create an Azure file share in the Azure portal 

[!include [banner](../../includes/banner.md)]

Electronic documents generated by Electronic invoicing service can be stored in Microsoft Azure file share, provisioned under a storage account. To ensure that Electronic invoicing can access the file share, you must provide the connection string to the Electronic invoicing service. Additionally, to ensure that the connection string is securely stored, don't provide the connection string directly. Instead, store it in an Azure key vault, and provide an Azure Key Vault secret.

## Prerequisites

Before you begin the procedures in this article, provision an Azure storage account:

- Steps to provision an Azure storage account are described in [Provision Azure storage account](../global/gs-e-invoicing-create-azure-storage-account-azure-portal.md).


## Create an Azure file share

To create an Azure file share:

1. Select the storage account from your dashboard.
1. In the service menu, under **Data storage**, select **File shares**.

1. On the menu at the top of the **File shares** page, select **+ File share**. The **New file share** page drops down.
1. In **Name**, enter a file share name. File share names must be all lower-case letters, numbers, and single hyphens, and must begin and end with a lower-case letter or number. The name can't contain two consecutive hyphens. For details about naming file shares and files, see [Naming and Referencing Shares, Directories, Files, and Metadata](/rest/api/storageservices/Naming-and-Referencing-Shares--Directories--Files--and-Metadata).
1. Select **Review + create** and then **Create** to create the Azure file share.


To get connection string:

1. Go to Azure portal (portal.azure.com) with your subscription and locate to the corresponding Storage account resource.
   Security + Networking -> Access keys; copy the value from key 1 Connection string

   ![Azure file share connection string.](../media/azure-file-share-connection-string.png)
   
3. Store the Connection string value in the Key vault secret, see details of how to setup Azure Key vault [Configure Azure key vault](../global/gs-e-invoicing-create-azure-key-vault-azure-portal.md).
4. Refer to the Key vault secret in key vault parameters, see [Configure key vault parameters](../global/gs-e-invoicing-set-up-parameters.md).
 

Note: Do not mix Connection string value and the storage shared access signature (SAS) token.
