Globalization Studio lets you create Globalization features that can be used in the following Globalization services: Electronic Invoicing and Tax Calculation. You can perform these tasks:

- Define related components of a feature.
- Manage the feature lifecycle through a feature's status.

To use a Globalization feature, you must first import it from a Dataverse repository and create your own version of it. There are two ways to add Globalization features:

- Add a derived feature that's based on an existing feature that has been published or shared.
- Add a new feature that you created from scratch.

## Feature component overview

Globalization features have several components:

- **Version** – This component supports feature lifecycle management. It lets users manage the status of different versions of the feature.
- **Configurations** – This component lets users manage, view, and edit related Electronic reporting (ER) formats and format mappings.
- **Setups** – This component lets users of Globalization services, such as an e-invoicing service, manage the setup of the related feature version. Therefore, it supports the flexible construction of communication and responses rules.
