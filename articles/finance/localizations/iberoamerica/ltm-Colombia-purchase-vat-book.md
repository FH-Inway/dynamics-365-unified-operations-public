# Configure Colombian purchase VAT book printing
	
[!INCLUDE[banner](../../includes/banner.md)]

This article explains how to configure the Colombian purchase value-added tax (VAT) book report so that it can be printed. The purchase VAT book report is the record and accounting document that businesses use to keep a record of their purchase transactions. Although the specific VAT ledger requirements might vary from one country/region to another, they typically include the transaction date, customer information, and tax information details.

## Prerequisites

Before you can generate and print the report, the following prerequisites must be met:

- The legal entity's address must be in a country/region that is within the LATAM localization (in this case, Colombia).
- Both the country/region-specific LATAM feature for Colombia and the general LATAM feature must be enabled.
- You must download the relevant report from the Dataverse repository. Learn more in [Import Electronic reporting (ER) configurations from Dataverse](../global/workspace/gsw-import-er-config-dataverse.md).
- You must configure the Electronic reporting (ER) parameters. Learn more in [Configure the Electronic reporting (ER) framework](../../../fin-ops-core/dev-itpro/analytics/electronic-reporting-er-configure-parameters.md).
- You must post purchase invoices, credit and debit notes.

## Set up application-specific parameters

Lookups and conditions are designed so that you can select the combination of document classification IDs and sales tax codes that are used in sales transactions. 
To set up application-specific parameters, follow these steps.

1. Open the **Electronic Reporting** workspace and select **Report Configurations**.
1. Select the **CO Compras** format and then, on the Action Pane, on the **Configuration** tab, in the **Application specific parameters** group, select **Setup**.
1. In the **Lookups** FastTab, in the **Name** column, select **Applicable Vendor Invoices**.
1. In the **Conditions** FastTab, select **Add**.
1. In the **Lookup result** column, specify whether the document is applicable.
1. In the **Document classification id** column, add the document classes that are included in this report as purchase invoices.
1. In the **Lookups** FastTab, in the **Name** column, select **VendorCreditNoteIsApplicable**.
1. In the **Conditions** FastTab, select **Add**.
1. In the **Lookup result** column, specify whether the document is applicable.
1. In the **Document classification id** column, add the document classes that are included in this report as purchase credit notes.
1. In the **Lookups** FastTab, in the **Name** column, select **TaxType**.
1. In the **Conditions** FastTab, select **Add**.
1. In the **Lookup result** column, specify the tax type.
1. In the **Tax code** column, specify the tax code for each case.

> [!NOTE]
> **CO Compras** is a format that depends on the **LTM Tax Report** model. Therefore, it's important that taxes are recorded for the transactions. The codes that you select here must match the codes that are recorded on the transactions. To ensure that the report shows the transactions that meet the configured conditions, complete the conditions with blank and non-blank conditions.

## Run the Colombia sales VAT book

To generate the sales VAT book report, follow these steps.

1. In the **From date** and **To date** fields, enter the date range to include in the report.
