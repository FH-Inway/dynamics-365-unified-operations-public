# Configure printing for Goods and Services sales Submission Form 607

[!INCLUDE[banner](../../includes/banner.md)]

This article explains how to configure the Goods and Services Sales Submission Form (607) so it can be printed as the **Format 607 DO** report. Sales transaction records that companies use to keep a detailed record of their operations indicate customer information and document details. As applicable, they also indicate any corresponding taxes and tax withholdings.

## Prerequisites

Before you can generate the **Format 607 DO** report, the following prerequisites must be met:

- The legal entity's address must be in the Dominican Republic.
- Both the country/region-specific LATAM feature for the Dominican Republic and the general LATAM feature must be enabled.
- You must download the specific report configuration from the Microsoft Dataverse configuration repository. Learn more in [Import Electronic reporting (ER) configurations from Dataverse](../global/workspace/gsw-import-er-config-dataverse.md).
- You must configure the Electronic reporting (ER) parameters. Learn more in [Configure the Electronic reporting (ER) framework](/dynamics365/fin-ops-core/dev-itpro/analytics/electronic-reporting-er-configure-parameters).

## Other required configuration for the Format 607 DO report

- You must create a tax application to use on the report. The tax application ID must be set to **F607**. Learn more in [Tax application for Latin America](../ltm-core-tax-application.md).
- You must configure master field list 1 to add and classify the type of income for your sales. You can add the corresponding code in the **Tax application** option. Learn more in [Field list configuration for Latin America](ltm-core-field-master-lists.md).
- You must create sales tax codes that will be used for Tax on Transfers of Industrialized Goods and Services (ITBIS), including ITBIS 18% (for goods) and ITBIS 0% (for services).
- You must create and configure one document class payment medium for each type, such as cash and bank transfer. Learn more in [Document classes for Latin America](ltm-core-document-class.md). Then, in the **Tax application** option, you must configure the payment medium with one item from the following list.

    | Document class payment | Code |
    |---|---|
    | Cash | E |
    | Check, bank transfer, deposit | D |
    | Debit or credit card | C |
    | Bonds or Gift Certificates | B |
    | Swap | P |
    | Other forms of sales | O |

- In the document class for sales transactions (invoices, debit notes, or credit notes), in the **Additional data** section, in the field list, you must configure field 1 as required.
