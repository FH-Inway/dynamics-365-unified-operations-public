# Configure printing for the Electronic Purchase Register (RCE) for purchases not domiciled in Peru

[!include [banner](../../includes/banner.md)]

This article explains how to configure printing for the Electronic Purchase Register (RCE) for purchases not domiciled in Peru in Microsoft Dynamics 365 Finance.

The RCE enables taxpayers to manage their electronic purchase records. The Peruvian fiscal authority Superintendencia Nacional de Aduanas y de AdministraciÃ³n Tributaria (SUNAT) generates a monthly proposal designed to serve as a comparative tool, helping taxpayers identify discrepancies in their records.

The RCE for purchases not domiciled in Peru includes annexes 9, 12.8.5 and 13.5.2. The Excel output version of the 13.5.2 annex is also included.

## Prerequisites

Before you can generate and print the reports, the following prerequisites must be met:

- The legal entity's address must be in Peru.
- You must enable both the general LATAM feature and the country/region-specific LATAM feature for Peru.
- You must download the specific report configuration from the Dataverse configuration repository. Learn more in [Import Electronic reporting (ER) configurations from Dataverse](/dynamics365/finance/localizations/global/workspace/gsw-import-er-config-dataverse).
- You must configure the electronic reporting (ER) parameters. Learn more in [Configure the Electronic reporting (ER) framework](../../../fin-ops-core/dev-itpro/analytics/electronic-reporting-er-configure-parameters.md).

The RCE for nondomiciled purchases in Peru is composed of the following formats that you must import:
- Last twelve months (LTM) Tax Report
- LTM Tax Report mapping
- RCE-ANEXO 9
- RCE-ANEXO 12.8.5
- RCE-ANEXO 13.5.2
- Non-resident Purchase Register

## Additional configurations required for RCE

- You must create a SUNAT tax application code to use on the report. Learn more in [Tax application for Latin America](../ltm-core-tax-application.md).
- When configuring document classes for purchase invoices, debit notes, credit notes, and DUA-DSI declaration (customs legal requirements), the tax application code must be set according to SUNAT Table 3: Types of Payment Receipts or Documents.
- If the DAM-DSI (customs legal requirements) emission year is required for a transaction, you must enable the **Concept 1** field from the document class.
- If the DAM-DSI (customs legal requirements) code from SUNAT Table 4 is required for the transaction, use the **Concept 2** field from the document class.
- It's possible to associate invoices and the DUA-DSI declaration through the source document if needed.
    1. In Dynamics 365 Finance, go to **Accounts payable \> Inquiries and reports \> Invoice \> Invoice journal**.
    1. On the FastTab for the desired transaction, select **LATAM \> Source Documents**.
    1. Select **New**.
    1. Add the required record.
- Set up the tax application code of the **Tax ID types** used with the SUNAT Table 1 codes. Learn more in [Tax ID types for Latin America](/dynamics365/finance/localizations/iberoamerica/ltm-core-tax-id-type).
- When you create a person type vendor, the **Phonetic last name** field allows you to add a second last name if required.
- When you create an organization type vendor, the **Organization number** field allows you to configure the SUNAT income type code if required.
- Go to **General ledger \> Currencies \> Currencies** and complete the currency tax application code with the appropriate three-letter code from SUNAT Table 2: Currency Type.
- Set up the tax application code of the **Country/region** records used with the SUNAT country code table and the user-defined field 1 with the SUNAT code of the agreement to avoid double taxation. Learn more in [Address setup for Latin America]( /dynamics365/finance/localizations/iberoamerica/ltm-core-address-setup#countryregion-configuration).
