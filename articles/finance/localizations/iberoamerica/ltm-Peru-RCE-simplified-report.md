# Configure printing for the simplified annex of the Electronic Purchase Register (RCE) for Peru

[!include [banner](../../includes/banner.md)]

This article explains how to configure printing for the simplified annex of the Electronic Purchase Register (RCE) for Peru in Microsoft Dynamics 365 Finance. The Excel output version is also included.

Taxpayers can use the RCE to manage their electronic purchase records. The National Superintendency of Customs and Tax Administration (SUNAT), the fiscal authority in Peru, generates a monthly proposal. This proposal is designed to serve as a comparative tool that taxpayers can use to identify discrepancies in their records.

The simplified version of the RCE includes annex 13.5.3. 

## Prerequisites

Before you can generate and print the reports, the following prerequisites must be met:

- The legal entity's address must be in Peru.
- You must enable both the general LATAM feature and the country/region-specific LATAM feature for Peru.
- You must download the specific report configuration from the Dataverse configuration repository. Learn more in [Import Electronic reporting (ER) configurations from Dataverse](../global/workspace/gsw-import-er-config-dataverse.md).
- You must configure the Electronic reporting (ER) parameters. Learn more in [Configure the Electronic reporting (ER) framework](../../../fin-ops-core/dev-itpro/analytics/electronic-reporting-er-configure-parameters.md).
- The simplified annex of the RCE consists of the following formats. You must import all these formats.

    - Last twelve months (LTM) Tax Report
    - LTM Tax Report mapping
    - RCE-ANEXO 13.5.3
    - PE Simply Purchase Register (excel output)

## Additional configuration required for the RCE simplified reports including the excel output

- You must create a SUNAT tax application code to use on the report. Learn more in [Tax application for Latin America](ltm-core-tax-application.md).
- When you configure document classes for purchase invoices, debit notes, and credit notes, the tax application code must be set according to SUNAT table 3, "Types of Payment Receipts or Documents."
- You can associate invoices, debit notes, and credit notes through the source document as required.

    1. In Dynamics 365 Finance, go to **Accounts payable** \> **Inquiries and reports** \> **Invoice** \> **Invoice journal**.
    1. On the FastTab for the desired transaction, select **LATAM** \> **Source Documents**.
    1. Select **New**.
    1. Add the required record.

- Set up the tax application code of the tax ID types that are used with the codes from SUNAT table 1. Learn more in [Tax ID types for Latin America](ltm-core-tax-id-type.md).
- When you create a vendor of the **Person** type, you can use the **Phonetic last name** field to add a second last name as required.
- Go to **General ledger** \> **Currencies** \> **Currencies**, and complete the currency tax application code with the appropriate three-letter code from SUNAT table 2, "Currency Type."
