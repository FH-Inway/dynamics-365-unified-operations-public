# Configure printing for the simplified annex of the Electronic Purchase Register (RCE) in Peru

[!include [banner](../../includes/banner.md)]

This article explains how to configure for printing the simplified annex of the Electronic Purchase Register (RCE) for Peru in Microsoft Dynamics 365 Finance.

The RCE enables taxpayers to manage their electronic purchase records. The Peruvian fiscal authority Superintendencia Nacional de Aduanas y de AdministraciÃ³n Tributaria (SUNAT) generates a monthly proposal designed to serve as a comparative tool, helping taxpayers identify discrepancies in their records.

The simplified version of the RCE includes the 13.5.3 annex. The Excel output version is also included.

## Prerequisites

Before you can generate and print the reports, the following prerequisites must be met:
- The legal entity's address must be in Peru.
- You must enable both the general LATAM feature and the country/region-specific LATAM feature for Peru.
- You must download the specific report configuration from the Dataverse configuration repository. Learn more in [Import Electronic reporting (ER) configurations from Dataverse](https://learn.microsoft.com/dynamics365/finance/localizations/global/workspace/gsw-import-er-config-dataverse).
- You must configure the electronic reporting (ER) parameters. Learn more in [Configure the Electronic reporting (ER) framework](../../../fin-ops-core/dev-itpro/analytics/electronic-reporting-er-configure-parameters.md).

The simplified annex for RCE is composed of the following formats that you must import:
- Last twelve months (LTM) Tax Report
- LTM Tax Report mapping
- RCE-ANEXO 13.5.3
- PE Simply Purchase Register

## Additional configurations required for RCE

- You must create a SUNAT tax application code to use on the report. Learn more in [Tax application for Latin America](../ltm-core-tax-application.md).
- When configuring document classes for purchase invoices, debit notes, and credit notes, the tax application code must be set according to SUNAT Table 3: Types of Payment Receipts or Documents.
- It's possible to associate invoices, debit notes and credit notes through the source document if needed.
    1. In Dynamics 365 Finance, go to **Accounts payable \> Inquiries and reports \> Invoice \> Invoice journal**.
    1. On the FastTab for the desired transaction, select **LATAM \> Source Documents**.
    1. Select **New**.
    1. Add the required record.
- Set up the tax application code of the **Tax ID types** used with the SUNAT Table 1 codes. Learn more in [Tax ID types for Latin America](https://learn.microsoft.com/dynamics365/finance/localizations/iberoamerica/ltm-core-tax-id-type).
- When you create a person type vendor, the **Phonetic last name** field allows you to add a second last name if required.
- Go to **General ledger \> Currencies \> Currencies** and complete the currency tax application code with the appropriate three-letter code from SUNAT Table 2: Currency Type.
