[!include [banner](../../includes/banner.md)]

This article explains how to configure printing for the simplified version of the Electronic Sales and Income Registry (RVIE) report for Peru in Microsoft Dynamics 365 Finance including the excel output.

The simplified RVIE report in Peru is a record of sales and income. It's used to modify proposed reports by the National Superintendency of Customs and Tax Administration (SUNAT). The simplified RVIE report includes annex 5.2.

## Prerequisites

Before you can generate and print simplified RVIE reports, the following prerequisites must be met:

- The legal entity's address must be in Peru.
- You must enable both the general LATAM feature and the country/region-specific LATAM feature for Peru.
- You must download the specific report configuration from the Dataverse configuration repository. Learn more in [Import Electronic reporting (ER) configurations from Dataverse](../global/workspace/gsw-import-er-config-dataverse.md).
- You must configure the Electronic reporting (ER) parameters. Learn more in [Configure the Electronic reporting (ER) framework](../../../fin-ops-core/dev-itpro/analytics/electronic-reporting-er-configure-parameters.md).
- The simplified RVIE report consists of the following formats that you must import:

    - LTM Tax Report mapping
    - LTM Tax Report
    - REG Vtas E Ing Simplicado
    - PE Simplified Sales Register (excel output)

## Additional configuration required for simplified RVIE annex reports including the excel output

- You must create a SUNAT tax application code to use on the report. Learn more in [Tax application for Latin America](ltm-core-tax-application.md).
- When you configure document classes for purchase invoices, debit notes, and credit notes, the tax application code must be set according to SUNAT table 3, "Types of Payment Receipts or Documents."
- You can associate debit notes and credit notes with invoices through the source document as required.

    1. In Dynamics 365 Finance, go to **Accounts payable** \> **Inquiries and reports** \> **Invoice** \> **Invoice journal**.
    1. On the FastTab for the desired transaction, select **LATAM** \> **Source Documents**.

- When you create a person of the **Person** type, you can use the **Phonetic last name** field to add a second last name as required.
- Go to **General ledger** \> **Currencies** \> **Currencies**, and complete the currency tax application code with the appropriate three-letter code from SUNAT table 2, "Currency Type."
