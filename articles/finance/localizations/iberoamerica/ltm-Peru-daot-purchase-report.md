# Configure printing for Annual Declaration of Transactions with Third Parties (DAOT) purchases report for Peru

[!include [banner](../../includes/banner.md)]

This article explains how to set up and generate the Annual Declaration of Transactions with Third Parties (DAOT) purchases report for Peru in Microsoft Dynamics 365 Finance.

The DAOT is an informative declaration that companies must submit to Superintendencia Nacional de Aduanas y de AdministraciÃ³n Tributaria (SUNAT), the fiscal authority in Peru. This declaration includes detailed information about transactions with vendors and customers that exceed certain value thresholds.
In this article, we will focus exclusively on the purchases report.

## Prerequisites

Before you complete the steps to generate the report, the following prerequisites must be met:
- The legal entity's address must be in Peru.
- You must enable both the general LATAM feature and the country/region-specific LATAM feature for Peru.
- You must download the specific report configuration from the Dataverse configuration repository. Learn more in [Import Electronic reporting (ER) configurations from Dataverse](/dynamics365/finance/localizations/global/workspace/gsw-import-er-config-dataverse).
- The following formats constitute the DAOT:
    - File export DAOT purchases
    - DAOT purchases (Excel)
- You must configure the electronic reporting (ER) parameters. Learn more in [Configure the Electronic reporting (ER) framework](../../../fin-ops-core/dev-itpro/analytics/electronic-reporting-er-configure-parameters.md).

## Aditional configurations required for DAOT

- You must create a SUNAT tax application code to use on the reports. Learn more in [Tax application for Latin America](../ltm-core-tax-application.md).
- Set up the tax application code of all the *taxpayer types* used with the SUNAT "table 2" codes. Learn more in [Taxpayer types for Latin America](/dynamics365/finance/localizations/iberoamerica/ltm-core-taxpayer-type).
- Set up the tax application code of all the tax ID types used with the SUNAT "table 1" codes. Learn more in [Tax ID types for Latin America](/dynamics365/finance/localizations/iberoamerica/ltm-core-tax-id-type).
- When creating a person type vendor, the phonetic last name field allows you to add a second last name if required.
