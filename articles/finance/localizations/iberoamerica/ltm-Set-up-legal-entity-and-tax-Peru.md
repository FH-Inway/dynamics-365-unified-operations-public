# Set up a legal entity and tax information for Peru

[!include [banner](../../includes/banner.md)]

This article explains how to set up a legal entity and tax information for a company in Peru with Microsoft Dynamics 365 Finance.

The following procedures walk you through how to use the Latin American (LATAM) features that are available in Dynamics 365 Finance to set up a legal entity and tax information for a company that is located in Peru. A legal entity represents the company and contains the tax and legal attributes that are required for the rest of the LATAM configuration.

Before you begin, in Dynamics 365 Finance, go to the **Feature management** workspace (**Systems administration** \> **Workspaces** \> **Feature management**) and verify that the **LATAM globalization expansion** and **LATAM globalization expansion â€“ Peru** features are enabled. If they aren't enabled, enable them. After you're sure that the features are enabled, complete the following procedures.

To create a legal entity, follow these steps.

1.	In Dynamics 365 Finance, go to **Organization administration** \> **Organizations** \> **Legal entities**, and select **New**.
1.	In the address setup, set up the address format for Peru.
