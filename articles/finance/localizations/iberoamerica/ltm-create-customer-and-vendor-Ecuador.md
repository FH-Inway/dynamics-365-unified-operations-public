The Ecuatorian customer and vendor configuration contains the fiscal information that's required by the fiscal authorities. The configuration also includes a reference to the document classes that can be used in transactions with customers and vendors.

# Prerequisites
Before you create records for customers and vendors who are located in Ecuador, the following setup must be completed:
- Address formats that are specific to Ecuador. These formats must use country as Ecuador and states/province for provinces.
- Create the tax codes that will be used for value-added tax (VAT), including VAT  13%, VAT 0%, etc.
- Sales tax groups that contain the tax codes that were created.
- Item sales tax groups that contain the tax codes that were created.
- Create Document classes to use with customer and vendor invoices, credit notes, debit notes, packing slips, and so on.  For more information, see [Configure sales and purchase invoices for Ecuador](ltm-configure-invoices-Ecuador.md).
- A customer and vendor set that contains all the document classes that will be used.
- A tax ID for each type of tax identification that your customers and vendors have.
- A taxpayer type for each type of taxpayer that your customers and vendors have.
