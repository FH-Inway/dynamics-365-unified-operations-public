This article explains how to configure the information that is required to generate the electronic invoice XML for Ecuador.

## Prerequisites

Before you complete the procedure in this article, the following prerequisites must be met:

## Required configuration for Ecuadorian electronic invoices

Follow these steps to configure the information that the XML tags require, in the order that they require it.

1. Go to **Organization administration** \> **Setup** \> **LATAM** \> **Tax application**, and select **New** to create a tax application record that has the code **ECUFE** (Ecuadorian electronic invoice).

1. Go to **Organization administration** \> **Organizations** \> **Legal entities**, and follow these steps:

    1. In the **LATAM** section, in the **Country identification** field, enter the complete Unique Taxpayer Registry (Registro Ãšnico de Contribuyentes \[RUC\]) number.

    1. In the **Printing concepts 2** field, enter the city of the headquarters.
    1. In the **Printing concepts 3** field, enter the department of the headquarters.

1. Go to **Organization administration** \> **Setup** \> **LATAM** \> **Sales point prefix**, and set the **Prefix** field to the establishment code.

1. For shipping guide documents, you must create a shipping carrier. Go to **Inventory and management** \> **Setup** \> **Shipping carriers**, and follow these steps:

    1. Create a record.
    1. On the **LATAM** tab, set the **Tax payer type**, **Country document type**, and **Country identification number** fields to appropriate values for the carrier.
    1. Create a transportation method. Its name will be used for the vehicle plate.

1. When you create a shipping guide, you must configure confirmed ship and receipt dates from the sales order lines.
1.	When you create a shipping guide, on the **Delivery** tab, you must configure delivery reasons from the sales order header.
1.	Go to **Tax** \> **Sales tax** \> **Sales tax codes**, and configure the required taxes for transactions.

    1. For each tax that you configure, select **LATAM** \> **Tax application** on the Action Pane. Then, in the **Income tax code** field, configure the corresponding tax code from table 16, as specified by the regulation.
    1. In the **Code regime** field, configure the corresponding code from table 17, as specified by the regulation.
