10. Select a document class (invoice).
11. Complete prefix field with a value.
12. Complete document number field with a value.
13. Verify that **Withholding tax group** field must show the group assigned in the vendor configuration. If it doesnâ€™t, select one from the list.

16. In the debit field, enter a value.
16. Select a sales tax group and item tax group according to the expense.
