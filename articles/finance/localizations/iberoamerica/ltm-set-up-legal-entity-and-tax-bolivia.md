# Set up a legal entity and tax information for Bolivia

[!include [banner](../../includes/banner.md)]

This article explains how to set up a legal entity and tax information for a company that´s located in Bolivia using the Latin American (LATAM) features that are available in Microsoft Dynamics 365 Finance. A legal entity represents the company, and it contains the tax and legal attributes that are required for the rest of the LATAM configuration.

Before you begin, open the **Feature management** workspace, and verify that the **LATAM globalization expansion** and **LATAM globalization expansion – Bolivia** features are enabled. If it isn’t enabled, enable it. After you're sure that the feature is enabled, complete the following procedures.

## Create a legal entity

To create a legal entity, follow these steps.

1. Go to **Organization administration > Organizations > Legal entities >** and select **New**.
1. In the address setup, set up the address format for Bolivia.
1. Go to **Organization administration > Setup > LATAM > LATAM parameters**.
1. On the **Concept and notes** tab, in the **Legal entity** section set a field as **Activity**.

> [!NOTE] 
> This procedure describes the main settings that are required for localization. You can set other fields as required for other Finance features that you use.
