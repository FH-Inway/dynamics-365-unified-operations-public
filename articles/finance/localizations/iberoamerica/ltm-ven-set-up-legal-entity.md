# Set up a legal entity and tax information for Venezuela

[!INCLUDE[banner](../../includes/banner.md)]

This article explains how to set up a legal entity and tax information for a company in Venezuela by using the Latin American (LATAM) features that are available in Microsoft Dynamics 365 Finance. A legal entity represents the company. It contains the tax and legal attributes that are required for the rest of the LATAM configuration.

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, open the **Feature management** workspace, and verify that the **LATAM globalization expansion** and **LATAM globalization expansion â€“ Venezuela** features are enabled.

## Create a legal entity

To create a legal entity, follow these steps.

1. Go to **Organization administration** \> **Organizations** \> **Legal entities**, and select **New**.
1. In the address setup, set up the address format for Venezuela.
1. Go to **Organization administration** \> **Setup** \> **LATAM** \> **LATAM parameters**.
1. On the **Concept and notes** tab, in the **Legal entity** section, set a field as **Activity**.

> [!NOTE]
> This procedure describes the main settings that are required for localization. You can set other fields as required for other Finance features that you must use.

## Set up tax information

To set up tax information, follow these steps.

1. [Create a document class letter](ltm-core-document-class-letter.md) without a prefix. This document class letter is used in taxpayer and document class configurations.

1. In the **LATAM** section, configure the following tax and legal information for the legal entity:
