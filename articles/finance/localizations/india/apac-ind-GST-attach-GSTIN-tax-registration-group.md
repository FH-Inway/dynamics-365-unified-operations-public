To make the India localization solution for Goods and Services Tax (GST) in Microsoft Dynamics 365 Finance available, you must complete the following master data setup:

- Define a business vertical.
- Update the state code and union territory.
- Create a Goods and Services Tax Identification Number (GSTIN) master.
- Define GSTINs for the legal entity, warehouse, vendor, or customer masters.
- Define Harmonized System of Nomenclature (HSN) codes and Service Accounting Codes (SACs).
- Create main accounts for the GST posting type.
- Create a tax settlement period.
- Attach the GSTIN to a tax registration group.

To attach the GSTIN to a tax registration group, go to **Tax** \> **Setup** \> **Sales tax** \> **Tax registration group**, create a group, and define the required GSTIN.
