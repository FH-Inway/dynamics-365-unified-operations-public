# Propose special depreciation

[!include [banner](../../includes/banner.md)]

This article explains how to propose special depreciations for Japan in Microsoft Dynamics 365 Finance.

In Japan, a special depreciation is permitted under certain conditions. For the reserve method, this is a two-step task: you post the reserve, and then you post the reserve allocation. For the direct-off method, then you just post the reserve allocation. 

Before you complete the following procedure, you must first confirm that the fixed asset has been acquired, and you must first select the **Fixed Asset** configuration key.

The following procedures use the JPMF demo company data.
