This article explains how to settle customer consolidated invoices using a payment journal for Japan in Microsoft Dynamics 365 Finance.

In Japan, payments are made and settled against consolidated invoices.

The following procedure walks you through how to settle a consolidated invoice using a payment journal and payment proposal feature. 

The procedure uses the demo data company JPMF.

Before you complete the procedure, ensure that you've first created and confirmed a consolidated invoice. 

To settle customer consolidated invoices using a payment journal, follow these steps.

1. In Dynamics 365 Finance, go to **Accounts receivable \> Periodic tasks \> Consolidated invoice**.
1. In the **Consolidation ID** field, copy the value to reference later. You can use JPMF-000002 from the demo data company JPMF.
