# Get started with electronic invoicing for Malaysia

[!INCLUDE[banner](../../includes/banner.md)]

This article provides information to help you get started with electronic invoicing for Malaysia. It guides you through the configuration steps that are country/region-dependent in Microsoft Dynamics 365 Finance or Dynamics 365 Supply Chain Management.

After you configure electronic invoicing, you can generate, digitally sign, and submit the XML files of electronic invoices according to the [regulatory requirements in Malaysia](https://www.hasil.gov.my/en/e-invoice/).

![Diagram of the electronic invoicing workflow in Malaysia.](apac-mys-e-invoice-workflow.jpg)

> [!NOTE]
> The electronic invoicing approach that this article describes is implemented by using an invoicing service that's applicable only to cloud deployments of Finance or Supply Chain Management.

## Prerequisites

Before you begin the procedures in this article, the following prerequisites must be met:

- The primary address of the legal entity must be in Malaysia.
- Your company must be a registered taxpayer in Malaysia and must have the following registration numbers: **Tax Identification Number (TIN)** and **Business Registration Number (BRN)**.
- Obtain **Client ID** and **Client secret** values in the [Inland Revenue Board of Malaysia (IRBN)](https://www.hasil.gov.my/) (Lembaga Hasil Dalam Negeri Malaysia \[LHDN\]). These values serve as credentials that are used to establish a secure connection to the IRBN portal.
- Obtain a digital signature certificate from one of the [Malaysian certification authorities](https://www.mcmc.gov.my/en/sectors/digital-signature/list-of-licensees). This certificate is used for digital signing of generated electronic invoices.
- Become familiar with electronic invoicing as it's described in [Electronic invoicing overview](../global/gs-e-invoicing-service-overview.md).
- Do the common part of electronic invoicing service configuration as described in [Set up electronic invoicing](../global/gs-e-invoicing-set-up-overview.md).

## Configure Azure Key Vault

Create an Azure key vault to store the required certificates and secrets that are issued for your company. For more information, see [Configure Azure resources for Electronic invoicing](../global/gs-e-invoicing-set-up-azure-resources.md).

Add the following required elements in the key vault:

- The secret for the **Client secret** value that's used to establish secure communication to IRBN.
- The secret for the **Client ID** value that's used to establish secure communication to IRBN.
- The certificate that's used for digital signing of outgoing electronic invoices.

## Configure Key Vault parameters for electronic invoicing

To configure Key Vault parameters for electronic invoicing, follow these steps.

1. Go to **Organization administration** \> **Setup** \> **Electronic document parameters**.
1. On the **Electronic invoicing** tab, in the **Key Vault settings** section, in the **Key Vault** field, select the reference to the key vault that you created in the previous section.
1. In the **SAS token secret** field, select the name of the storage account secret URL that must be used to authenticate access to the storage account.
1. Select **Key Vault parameters**.
1. On the **Key Vault parameters** page, in the **Certificates** section, select **Add** to create new elements of the appropriate type for each certificate or secret that's described in the previous section.

    - <a id="ClSec"></a>A **Client secret** element of the **Secret** type
    - <a id="ClID"></a>A **Client ID** element of the **Secret** type
    - <a id="DigCert"></a>A **Certificate** element of the **Certificate** type

    > [!NOTE]
    > The values in the **Name** column should match the names of the certificates or secrets that are described in the previous section.

## Configure the electronic invoicing feature

Some of the parameters from the **Malaysian electronic invoicing (MY)** electronic invoicing feature are published with default values. Before you deploy this feature to the service, review the default values, and update them as required, so that they better reflect your business operations.

To configure the electronic invoicing feature, follow these steps.

1. Import the latest version of the **Malaysian electronic invoicing (MY)** Globalization feature as described in [Import features from the repository](../global/gs-e-invoicing-import-feature-global-repository.md).
1. Create a copy of the imported Globalization feature, and select your configuration provider for it. For more information, see [Create a Globalization feature](../global/gs-e-invoicing-create-new-globalization-feature.md).
1. On the **Versions** tab, verify that the **Draft** version is selected.
1. On the **Setups** tab, in the grid, select the **Sales invoice derived** feature setup, and then select **Edit**.
1. On the **Processing pipeline** tab, in the **Processing pipeline** section, select the **Sign document for Malaysia** action.
1. In the **Parameters** section, select the **Certificate name** parameter, and then, in the **Value** field, select the name of the [digital certificate](#DigCert) that you created.
1. In the **Processing pipeline** section, select the **Integrate with MyInvois (Submit document)** action.
1. In the **Parameters** section, select the **Client secret** parameter, and then, in the **Value** field, select the name of the [secret](#ClSec) that you created.
1. Select the **Client ID** parameter, and then, in the **Value** field, select the name of the [client ID](#ClID) that you created.
1. In the **Parameters** section, select the **Web service URL** and **Login service URL** parameters. In the **Value** fields, enter the testing or production URLs, depending on the implementation stage. Review the list of available URLs in [MyInvois system environment URLs](https://sdk.myinvois.hasil.gov.my/faq/#what-are-the-environment-urls).

    > [!NOTE]
    > Alternatively, you can leave the **Web service URL** and **Login service URL** parameters blank. Instead, you can select the **Environment type** parameter, and then, in the **Value** field, select the type of the environment, depending on the implementation stage. In this case, the required URLs are automatically constructed. If the **Web service URL** and **Login service URL** parameters are defined, they have higher priority than the **Environment type** parameter.

    ![Screenshot of the setup on the Processing pipeline tab of the Feature version setup page for the electronic invoicing feature.](apac-mys-e-invoice-URLs.jpg)

1. Repeat steps 7 through 10 for the **Integrate with MyInvois (Get document)** action.
1. On the **Processing pipeline** tab, in the **Processing pipeline** section, select the **Generate QR code for Malaysia** action.

1. Select **Save**, and close the page.
1. Repeat steps 4 through 14 for the **Project invoice derived** and **Self invoice derived** feature setups.
1. The copy of the feature is always created as a **Draft** version. Regardless of whether you made changes, complete and deploy the feature as described in [Complete and deploy a Globalization feature](../global/gs-e-invoicing-complete-publish-deploy-globalization-feature.md).

## Configure electronic document parameters

To configure electronic document parameters, follow these steps.

1. Make sure that the country/region-specific Electronic reporting (ER) configurations for the document context and electronic document model mapping that are required for Malaysia are imported. For more information, see [Set up electronic invoicing parameters](../global/gs-e-invoicing-set-up-parameters.md#set-up-electronic-document-parameters).

    > [!NOTE]

    > [!NOTE]
    > **ResponseData** is the default name of the response type. If you must change it, make sure that the new name matches the name that was defined for the related variable of the **To client** type in the corresponding feature setups. To validate the variable's value, go to **Globalization Studio**, and select the **Electronic invoicing** tile. On the **Electronic invoicing features** page, verify that the **Malaysian electronic invoicing (MY)** feature is selected.
