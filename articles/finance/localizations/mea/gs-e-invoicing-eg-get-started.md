# Electronic invoicing in Egypt

[!include [banner](../../includes/banner.md)]

This article provides information to help you get started with Electronic invoicing for Egypt. It guides you through the configuration steps that are country/region-dependent in Microsoft Dynamics 365 Finance or Dynamics 365 Supply Chain Management. These steps complement the steps that are described in [Electronic invoicing configuration](../global/gs-e-invoicing-set-up-overview.md).

After you configure Electronic invoicing, you can generate JavaScript Object Notation (JSON) files of electronic invoices in the Egypt-specific format and submit them to the Egyptian tax authority.

> [!NOTE]
> Egyptian authorities provide the certificate for digital signing with the required key. They provide this certificate only as a hardware token device that can't be added to an Azure Key Vault. However, Dynamics 365 Finance enables files to be written to and read from an Azure file share, and that file share can be configured to enable external signing of electronic documents. To learn more, go to the Egyptian tax authority's website by using the link that is provided in [Egyptian eInvoicing & eReceipt SDK - Frequently asked questions](https://sdk.invoicing.eta.gov.eg/faq/).

## Prerequisites

Before you begin the procedures in this article, complete the following prerequisites:

- Become familiar with Electronic invoicing as it's described in [Electronic Invoicing service overview](../global/gs-e-invoicing-service-overview.md).
- Complete the common part of Electronic Invoicing service configuration as described in [Electronic invoicing configuration](../global/gs-e-invoicing-set-up-overview.md).
- The primary addresses of the legal entities must be in Egypt.

## Azure Key Vault configuration

Create an Azure Key Vault to store the required secrets that are issued for your company. For more information, see [Configure Azure resources for Electronic invoicing](../global/gs-e-invoicing-set-up-azure-resources.md).

Add the following required elements in the key vault:

- The secret for the **client ID**, which must ...
- The secret for the obtained **client secret**...

## Configure electronic invoicing Key Vault parameters

To configure electronic invoicing Key Vault parameters, follow these steps.

1. Go to **Organization administration** \> **Setup** \> **Electronic document parameters**.
1. On the **Electronic invoicing** tab, in the **Key Vault settings** section, in the **Key Vault** field, select the reference to the key vault that you created in the previous section of this article.
1. In the **SAS token secret** field, select the name of the storage account secret URL that must be used to authenticate access to the storage account.
1. Select **Key Vault parameters**.
1. On the **Key Vault parameters** page, in the **Certificates** section, select **Add** to create new elements of the appropriate type for each secret that is described in the previous section.

    - <a id="ClID"></a>The **Client ID** element of the **Secret** type.
    - <a id="PK"></a>The **Client secret** element of the **Secret** type.

    > [!NOTE]
    > The values in the **Name** column should match the names of the secrets that are described in the previous section.


## Configure an Azure file share

- Configure an Azure file share as described in [Create an Azure file share in the Azure portal](../global/gs-e-invoicing-create-azure-file-share.md).


## Import the electronic invoicing feature

Import the **Egyptian electronic invoice (EG)** electronic invoicing feature, version **20** or later, from the repository. Learn more in [Import features from the repository](../global/gs-e-invoicing-import-feature-global-repository.md).

## Configure the electronic invoicing feature

Some of the parameters from the **Egyptian electronic invoice (EG)** electronic invoicing feature are published with default values. Before you deploy the electronic invoicing feature, review the default values, and update them as required, so that they better reflect your business operation.

> [!NOTE]
> ... only what is described below... the rest is on your iwn risk...

To configure the electronic invoicing feature, follow these steps.

1. Make sure that the latest version of the **Egyptian electronic invoice (EG)** Globalization feature is imported as described in [Import features from the repository](../global/gs-e-invoicing-import-feature-global-repository.md).
1. Create a copy of the imported Globalization feature, and select your configuration provider for it. Learn more in [Create Globalization features](../global/gs-e-invoicing-create-new-globalization-feature.md).
1. On the **Versions** tab, verify that the **Draft** version is selected.
1. On the **Feature parameters** tab, specify values for the following connection and integration parameters. These parameters are required for interoperation with Egyptian tax authority's services.

    - **EgyptianETAClientID** – Enter the client ID that the regulatory authority provided.
    - **EgyptianETAClientSecret** – Enter the secret that the regulatory authority provided.
    - **EgyptianETAConnectionString** – Enter the connection string for the Azure file share that you provisioned as described in [Create an Azure file share in the Azure portal](../global/gs-e-invoicing-create-azure-file-share.md).
    - **EgyptianETASendToFileShareDirectory** – Enter the name of the Azure file share directory that invoices for digital signing should be written to.
    - **EgyptianETAGetFromAzureFileShare** – Enter the name of the Azure file share directory that digitally signed invoices should be read from.
    - **EgyptianETALoginserviceURL** – Enter the URL of the Egyptian tax authority's login service. The feature that Microsoft released points to the pre-production endpoint.
    - **EgyptianETAWebserviceURL** – Enter the URL of the Egyptian tax authority's web service. The feature that Microsoft released points to the pre-production endpoint.

    The following illustration shows an example of a feature parameter setup that includes the URL for the Egyptian tax authority's pre-production endpoint.

    > [!NOTE]
    > Because external signing is involved, features that Microsoft publishes repeatedly check the availability of signed invoices until a maximum limit is reached. You can reconfigure the retry parameters as you require by following the next two steps.

1. To reconfigure the retry parameters, on the **Setups** tab, select the **Sales invoice** or **Project invoice** setup, depending on the scenario. Then select **Edit**.
1. On the **Processing pipeline** tab, select the **Get from Azure file share** action, and then, in the **Retry parameters** section, configure the required values.
