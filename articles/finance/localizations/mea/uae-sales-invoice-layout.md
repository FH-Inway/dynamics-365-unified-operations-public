# Print a sales invoice in the United Arab Emirates layout

This article includes country/region-specific information about how to print a sales invoice in the United Arab Emirates (UAE) layout.

In the UAE localization package, printouts for sales invoices and credit notes are included in the layout that's specified in the Federal Tax Authority (FTA) requirements for accounting systems.

The new printouts can be generated in two languages. The system prints one invoice in the user interface (UI) language. At the same time, if the UI language differs from the language of the customer, the system prints a second invoice in the language of the customer.

To achieve consistent printout results, set up other data in the system so that it has translations. For example, on the **Released product** page, set up the names and descriptions of items in different languages. You should also consider setting up sales tax descriptions and exempt codes so that they have translations.

The following illustration shows an example of the printout for a free text invoice.
