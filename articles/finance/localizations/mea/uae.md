# United Arab Emirates (UAE) overview

[!include [banner](../../includes/banner.md)]

This article provides links to documentation resources for the United Arab Emirates (UAE).

- [Set up and report value-added tax (VAT)](uae-vat-setup-reporting.md)
- [FTA Tax Audit File (FAF) in TXT format](uae-faf.md)
- [Print a sales invoice in the UAE layout](uae-sales-invoice-layout.md)

## Activate the UAE functionality

Country-specific functionality for the UAE is activated by using the **Localized functionality region** configuration for legal entities. If the company address is used to detect the **Localized functionality region** configuration, make sure that the country/region code of the legal entity's primary address is set to **ARE** on the **Legal entities** page.

For more information about the patterns that are used in localized solutions, see the [Localization and regulatory features website](../../../fin-ops-core/fin-ops/lcs/country-region.md).
