This article explains how to set up and maintain Norwegian payment IDs in Microsoft Dynamics 365 Finance.

A payment identification (ID) is a unique identifier for customer payments that are settled electronically. It can be divided into different parts, such as the customer account number, invoice number, prefix, suffix, and external reference. When you receive a payment from a customer, the payment ID identifies the payment transaction for a sales invoice that is received from a bank.

The following procedures walk you through how to set up and maintaining Norwegian payment IDs, and were created using the demo data company DEMF with the country/region of legal entity primary address updated to be Norway.

## Set up payment IDs

To set up payment IDs, follow these steps.

1. In Dynamics 365 Finance, go to **Accounts receivable \> Payments setup \> Payment ID**.
1. Select **New**.

1. In the **Invoice from position** field, enter a number.
1. In the **Invoice to position** field, enter a number.
1. In the **Modulo** field, select **Modulo 10**.
    Select the modulo check method to calculate the check number. The last digit of a payment ID is reserved for the check number to verify that the payment ID is valid. The following options are available:     -     - **Modulo 10** – The total length of the payment ID is divided by 1. The remainder is the check number.
    - **Modulo 11** – The total length of the payment ID is divided by 1. The remainder is the check number.
    - (None) – No check number is calculated.  
1. Select **Save**. After saving the record, you can preview the selected payment ID in the Payment ID test field.
