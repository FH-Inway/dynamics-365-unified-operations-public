# Returnable packaging for Poland

[!include [banner](../../includes/banner.md)]

This article explains how to set up and use returnable packaging for Poland in Microsoft Dynamics 365 Finance.

The functionality for returnable packaging lets you handle the registration of packages that can be returned by customers. Users can define packaging codes and specify the amount of the deposit that a customer pays for returned packaging materials. This functionality is an extension of the standard functionality for packaging materials.

## Prerequisites

The following table shows the prerequisites that must be in place before you start.

| Category                | Prerequisite |
|-------------------------|--------------|
| **Setup:** Legal entity | The primary address of the legal entity must be in Poland. On the **Legal entities** page (**Organization administration** \> **Organizations** \> **Legal entities**), select your legal entity. Then, on the **Addresses** FastTab, create a new address or update an existing address, select **Poland** as the country/region, enter the other address components, and mark the address as **Primary**. |

## Set up returnable packages

This section describes the various settings that you must configure to use the returnable packages functionality.

### Define packaging codes

On the **Return packages** page (**Inventory management** \> **Setup** \> **Packing material** \> **Return packages**), enter values for the following fields.

| Field               | Description                                                                    |

### Attach packaging codes to packing units

Only the following field is specific for Poland. It extends the standard functionality of the **Packaging material allocation** page.

| Field          | Description                                                     |
