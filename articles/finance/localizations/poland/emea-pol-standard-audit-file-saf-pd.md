[!include [banner](../../includes/banner.md)]

This article explains how users in legal entities in Poland can generate a SAF Accounting Books Income Tax - JPK_KR_PD in XML format and preview in Excel.

JPK_KR_PD (Jednolity Plik Kontrolny – Księgi Rachunkowe Podatnika) is a reporting standard in Poland that is mandatory for businesses as of January 1, 2025. It requires that taxpayers submit detailed accounting books in a structured electronic format. Large taxpayers must report the new SAF Accounting Books Income Tax - JPK_KR_PD for the first time in March 2026, which is their deadline for filing their 2025 tax returns.

Learn more about how to set up and generate a SAF Accounting Books - JPK_KR to report for periods before January 1, 2025, in [SAF Accounting Books - JPK_KR](emea-pol-standard-audit-file-saf-kr.md).
