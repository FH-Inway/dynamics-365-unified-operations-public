# Standard audit file, SAF (Jednolity Plik Kontrolny, JPK) for Poland overview

[!include [banner](../../includes/banner.md)]

Polandâ€™s JPK (Jednolity Plik Kontrolny) system is a standardized electronic reporting framework designed to enhance tax compliance and streamline communication between businesses and tax authorities. It requires the submission of various datasets in XML format, ensuring uniformity, machine readability, and ease of processing.

Dynamics 365 Finance supports generation of the following JPK files:

- [JPK_KR_PD](emea-pol-standard-audit-file-saf-pd.md) for taxpayer accounting books, offering comprehensive financial reporting.
- [JPK_WB](emea-pol-standard-audit-file-saf-wb.md) for bank statements, providing insights into financial flows.
- [JPK_MAG](emea-pol-standard-audit-file-saf-mag.md) for inventory management, capturing stock movements.
- [JPK_VAT](emea-pol-standard-audit-file-saf-vat.md) for VAT records, essential for tracking input and output tax.
- [JPK_FA](emea-pol-standard-audit-file-saf-fa.md) for detailed invoicing data, ensuring transparency in business transactions.

The XML-based structure of these reports allows for seamless data exchange and efficient analysis by the tax authorities. By standardizing formats, the JPK system supports more accurate audits and fosters compliance with Polish tax regulations.
