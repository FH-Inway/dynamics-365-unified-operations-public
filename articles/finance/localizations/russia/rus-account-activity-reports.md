# Account activity reports

[!include [banner](../../includes/banner.md)]

This article explains how to work with activity reports for Russia in Microsoft Dynamics 365 Finance.

## Turnover sheet with correspondence

The *turnover sheet with correspondence* is a basic component of the accounting reports. It's a multirow, multicolumn table that contains information about the activity for all accounts during the accounting period. The number of rows and columns in the table is determined by the number of account numbers from the chart of accounts that you set up on the **Query** page.

The top row and the leftmost column of the table contain the account numbers from the chart of accounts. The intersection of rows and columns shows the total of all transactions for the period. The correspondence of those transactions is determined by the account numbers in the top row and the leftmost column that correspond to the selected cell.

For each row and column in the table, the totals are summarized. The summary for each row is recorded in the bottom row of the table, and the summary for each column is recorded in the rightmost column. The total amount of debit and credit turnover is shown in the cell at the intersection of the bottom row and the rightmost column.

To configure and generate the turnover sheet with correspondence, follow these steps.
