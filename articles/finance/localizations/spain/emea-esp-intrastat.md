# Spanish Intrastat

[!include [banner](../../includes/banner.md)]

This article explains how to set up and configure the Spanish Intrastat report in Microsoft Dynamics 365 Finance.

The **Intrastat** page is used to generate and report information about trade among European Union (EU) countries/region. The Spanish Intrastat declaration contains information about the trade of goods that you can use for reporting.

The following fields are included on the Spanish Intrastat declaration.

| **Field on the Intrastat declaration** | **Corresponding field on the Intrastat journal page** | **Description** |
|-------------------------|-------------------------|-------------------------|
| Dispatch/destination country | **Country/region** (in the **Dispatch/destination** section) | The member state that is the origin or destination of the goods. |
| County | **County of origin/destination** (in the **Dispatch/destination** section) | The Spanish province where goods were obtained (in the case dispatches) or arrive (in the case of arrivals). |
| Delivery terms | **Delivery terms** (in the **Codes** section) | How the commodities are transported to or from Spain. |
| Transaction code | **Transaction code** (in the **Codes** section) | The nature of the agreement that forms the basis for the delivery of commodities. |
| Transport | **Transport** (in the **Codes** section) | How the commodities are transported. |
| Port | **Port** (in the **Codes** section) | The unique port code. |
| Commodity code | **Commodity** (in the **Codes** section) | The eight-digit commodity code according to the Combined Nomenclature. |
| Origin country | **Country/region of origin** (in the **Country/region of origin** section) | The country or region where the commodities were produced or manufactured. |
| Statistics procedure | **Statistics procedure** (in the **Codes** section) | The detailed version of the commodity flow. |
| Net mass | **Weight** (in the **Data** section) | The mass of the goods of all positions of the Combined Nomenclature. The value includes goods that require the declaration of additional units but excludes the weight of the packaging. The net mass is specified in kilograms. |
| Additional units | **Quantity of additional units** (in the **Unit** section) | For some commodities, you must report the supplementary unit, such as the number of items, and the number of m2, m3, pairs, and dozens. |
| Invoice amount | **Invoice amount** (in the **Invoice value** section) | The taxable amount. This amount constitutes the value that must be determined for tax purposes. |
| Statistical value | **Statistical value** (in the **Statistical value** section) | The value that the company would have at the time of entry into (in the case of arrivals) or departure from (in the case of dispatches) the Spanish statistical territory, after taxes on consumption (but no other taxes) are deducted. The value includes a proportional part of the transport and insurance costs of the journey up to the point where the goods enter or leave Spanish territory.</br>For more information, see the description of the prerequisite for miscellaneous charges in [Intrastat overview](../europe/emea-intrastat.md). |
