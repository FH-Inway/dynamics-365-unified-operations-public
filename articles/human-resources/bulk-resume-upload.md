The Bulk Resume Upload AI feature in Dynamics 365 Human Resources Recruiting add-on is an AI-powered tool designed to optimize and automate the process of uploading, organizing, and analyzing large quantities of 
resumes simultaneously. This feature is beneficial for companies and recruiters that receive a substantial number of applications for open positions, facilitating more efficient management and processing. This 
feature enables recruiters to upload multiple resumes simultaneously from various file formats (PDF, JPG, PNG, JPEG), significantly reducing the time required compared to manually uploading individual resumes. AI parses the uploaded resumes and generates candidate profiles by extracting all relevant information. Users can then review and edit these candidate profiles as necessary. 

Uploading a resume generates a batch that creates candidate profiles from the resumes. The system shows profile creation progress through a progress bar. Recruiters can view and click on candidate profile IDs to 
access detailed profiles extracted by AI, which they can review and edit as needed.
