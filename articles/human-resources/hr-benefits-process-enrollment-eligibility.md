## Clean up benefits eligibility process results

>[!NOTE]  
This feature is currently in **preview**. The functionality and behavior described may change before general availability (GA).

In Dynamics 365 Human Resources, you can now clean up old benefits eligibility process results to help maintain system performance.

Over time, the benefits of eligibility process result table can grow large and cause database timeouts. This new feature allows HR administrators to delete old records based on a specified retention period.

To use this feature, the **Benefits management** feature must be enabled.

**How it works:**

You can access the **Clean up benefits eligibility process results** from:

- **Human Resources > Benefits management > Processing > Clean up benefits eligibility process results**
- **Benefits management > Processing > Clean up benefits eligibility process results**
- **Workspaces > Benefits management > Links > Processing**

When running the cleanup:

- Enter the **Maximum age** (in days).
- Records older than the maximum age will be deleted.
- You can run the clean-up immediately or schedule it as a batch job.

The clean-up is **legal entity specific**.
