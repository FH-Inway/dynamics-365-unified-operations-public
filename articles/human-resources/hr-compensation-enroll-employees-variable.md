# Enroll an employee in a variable compensation plan

[!include [Applies to Human Resources](../includes/applies-to-hr.md)]

The Compensation and Benefits manager can enroll employees in variable compensation plans to calculate cash and non-cash awards for employees. This procedure assumes that a variable compensation plan has been created with the **Enable enrollment** field set to **Yes**, and that eligibility rules have been created for that variable compensation plan. The demo data company used to create this procedure is USMF. To begin this procedure, go to **Human resources** \> **Workers** \> **Employees** \> **Compensation** \> **Variable plan enrollment**.

1. Select **New**.
2. In the **Plan** field, select the dropdown button to open the lookup.

    The plan lookup will be filtered to only show the variable compensation plans that the employee is eligible for based on the eligibility rules.

3. In the list, select the link in the selected row.
4. Toggle the expansion of the **General** section.
5. In the **Effective date** field, enter a date.
6. Select **Save**.
7. Toggle the expansion of the **Overrides** section.

    * Optionally, a hire rule date can be set to override the hire date for an employee when the hire rule specified for the selected variable plan is Percent.
    * If the variable plan is a percent of basis plan, the award percentage can be overridden for the employee. If the variable compensation plan is a number of units plan, the number of units can be overridden for the employee.
    * If the employee should be given a flat amount for their award, the amount can be set here.

8. Toggle the expansion of the **Organizational overrides** section.

    If the employee's performance should take into consideration, the performance of different departments, or a department other than the one assigned on the employee's position, the department can be overridden. The **Percent** column should total 100.

> [!NOTE]
> This feature is currently in preview. The functionality and behavior that are described might change before general availability (GA).

In Dynamics 365 Human Resources, you can now associate **variable compensation plans**, including awards and enrollments, directly to an employee's **position**. This enhancement gives organization more flexibility to manage variable compensation in alignment with job roles. Therefore, it helps ensure a more accurate and scalable compensation strategy.

Previously, variable compensation plans were linked to the employee level. By associating plans with positions, HR managers can now streamline compensation planning, especially in organizations that have position-based structures.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> To start to use this functionality, enable the **Ability to link variable pay to position** feature in Feature management.

- **Payroll integration variable compensation enrollment position** (PayIntV1HcmVariableCompensationEnrollmentPositionEntity)
