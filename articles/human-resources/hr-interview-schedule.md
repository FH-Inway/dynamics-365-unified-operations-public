# Set up the Interview schedule feature in Dynamics 365 Human Resources Recruiting add-on (preview)
[This article is prerelease documentation and is subject to change.]

This article describes the Interview schedule feature in Dynamics 365 Human Resources Recruiting add-on.

[!INCLUDE [preview-note](~/../shared-content/shared/preview-includes/preview-note-d365.md)]

Customers currently need to manually coordinate interview times among various parties, including candidates, hiring managers, and interviewers. This process is time-consuming and prone to errors, potentially
leading to scheduling conflicts, missed opportunities, and delays in the hiring process. Additionally, a poor candidate experience can negatively impact the employer's brand and discourage top talent from
pursuing opportunities with the company. 

We have developed an efficient and well-organized interview scheduling system that reduces the time spent on manual coordination and communication and provides candidates with a more positive experience. This
system enables recruiters to book panel members' calendars, share available slots with candidates, send notifications, and issue meeting invitations. 

>[Note]
> Outlook and MS Teams licenses are required. 

## Find time slots  

This functionality allows recruiters to book time slots for panel members based on their Outlook calendar availability. Recruiters can either confirm the time slot with the panel member or directly select an
available time slot for booking.

### Share slots 

Recruiters can share confirmed interview slots with one or more applicants. These applicants receive an email notification containing these confirmed slots. Each applicant can only select one slot at a time. In cases where two applicants select the same slot simultaneously, the system determines which applicant applied first and an updated list of available slots is sent to the other applicant. 

To share slots with candidates, follow these steps:
1. Click **Interview Scheduling** on the left menu.
2. Choose the job ad for the interview.
3. Go to **Send meeting invite**.

### Send the meeting invite  
After the candidate books a time slot, the recruiter can send the meeting invitation. They can confirm the slot with the applicant and send the meeting invite by selecting an appropriate template for the content that needs to be sent to both the candidate and the interviewer. 

To send a meeting invite, follow these steps:
1. Click **Interview scheduling** in the left menu.
2. Select the job ad to schedule an interview for.
3. Go to **Send meeting invite** tab.
4. Select the applicant with a confirmed slot status and click **Send invite**.

An email notification is sent to the candidate and a Teams notification is sent to the interviewer with a meeting invite link. 

### Provide feedback 

Interviewers can now send feedback directly from Microsoft Teams. During or after the interview, a feedback page is sent to the interviewer's Microsoft Teams. The interviewer can fill out the form and submit it. The feedback is updated in the HR recruiting add-on, which the recruiter can view to make decisions. 

To provide feedback, follow these steps:
1. Interviewer receives a feedback notification when the meeting starts.
2. Interviewer provides feedback on Microsoft Teams during or after the interview.
3. Recruiter views feedback in the HR recruiting add-on. 
Applicants are moved to the next stage or rejected based on feedback. 

>[!Note]
> The feedback page isn't sent if the meeting invitation is sent manually. The feedback page is only sent when the send meeting invite functionality is used in the recruiting add-on or interview scheduling.
