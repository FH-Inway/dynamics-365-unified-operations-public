# Use the dashboard in the HR Recruiting app (preview)

[This article is prerelease documentation and is subject to change.]

This article describes the dashboard in the HR Recruiting app in Microsoft Dynamics 365 Human Resources.

[!INCLUDE [preview-note](~/../shared-content/shared/preview-includes/preview-note-d365.md)]

## Dashboard

The dashboard appears on the home page of the Recruiting add-on app. It shows a summary of the progress of the recruiting process.

The following built-in charts are available:

- Job ads by status
- Upcoming interviews
- Pending approvals
- Ready to hire candidates

### Job ads by status

This pie chart shows the statuses of the job ads that the user is connected to. For example, a recruiter participated as a hiring team member in four job ads. One of those job ads is a draft, another is in progress, and two are completed. This chart shows all four jobs by their status. Users can access the summary of job ads.

### Upcoming interviews

This list view shows all upcoming interviews for the user.

### Pending approvals

This list view shows the pending approvals for the user who must approve them. It helps the approver view all the pending approvals that require user action.

### Ready to hire candidates

This line chart shows the number of candidates who are marked as hired in the Recruiting add-on app. It helps users view how many candidates were hired over different years. Users can also drill down into the charts by selecting an attribute.
