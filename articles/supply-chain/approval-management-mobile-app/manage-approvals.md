This article explains how to use the Approvals Management mobile app to approve, reject, or delegate approval requests.

## User requirements

To manage purchasing requests from the Approvals Management mobile app, you must meet the following requirements:

- You must sign in to Microsoft Power Apps by using a domain account, and that domain account must match a user account in Dynamics 365 Supply Chain Management that has the same Microsoft Entra ID user name.
- Your user account in Supply Chain Management must be assigned the required security roles for the types of approvals that you must manage. Learn more in [Set up user accounts to manage approvals in Supply Chain Management](developer/onboard-approval-app.md#roles-approvals).

## Home page

When you open the Approvals Management mobile app and sign in, the home page appears. This page provides an overview of requests that are awaiting your approval.

The following illustration highlights the user interface (UI) elements on the home page. Many of these elements are common to all pages in the app.

## List pages

List pages show a list of orders, requisitions, or line items that are awaiting your approval. The type of item that is shown depends on how you opened the list page. From a list page, you can select any item in the list to view more details about it. If you turn on multiselect, you can select one or more items, and then approve, reject, delegate, or request changes for all of them directly from the list page.

### List pages without multiselect

List pages where multiselect is turned off show a list of items that you can navigate and select to view more details. The following illustration highlights the UI elements on a list page where multiselect is turned off.
