You can generate a work order report that shows detailed information about one or more work orders that you select.

1. Select **Asset management** > **Reports** > **Work orders** > **Work order report**.

2. Select "Yes"/"No" on the toggle buttons as you require, to determine the details to be included in the report.  
    - In the **Print settings** section, you can select whether to include attachments from the setup of the related maintenance job type.

3. On the **Records to include** FastTab, you can filter the contents of the report by **Work order**.

4. On the **Run in the background** FastTab, you can set up generation of the work order report as a batch job, as you require.

5. Select **OK** to generate the report.

The following illustration shows an example of how the report parameters can be set up.
