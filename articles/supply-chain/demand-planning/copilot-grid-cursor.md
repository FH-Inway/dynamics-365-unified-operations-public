[!include [banner](../includes/banner.md)]

The *Copilot grid cursor* offers detailed insights into a selected time-series cell's value, including its original value, manual adjustments, and full adjustment history. User comments are also shown, to help make the changes easier to understand.

To use the Copilot grid cursor, follow these steps:

1. Open the time series that you want to analyze. For example, on the navigation pane, select **Planning data** \> **Forecasts**, and then select the time series.
1. In the **Time series values section**, find and select the cell that you want to analyze. After you select the cell, the Copilot icon appears to the right of the cell and points to it.
