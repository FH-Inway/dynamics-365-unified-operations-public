Demand planning in Microsoft Dynamics 365 Supply Chain Management lets you use Copilot to analyze your demand plans. You can select from a set of predefined questions. The app then provides answers in real time by using natural language.

By using Copilot, you can quickly gain valuable insights across multiple dimensions. You can use these insights to improve operational efficiency, increase profitability, and improve customer satisfaction.

For example, a demand planner is interested in learning the most significant factors that contributed to a notable shift between two consecutive periods. The planner opens the relevant worksheet, selects a point of interest on the chart, and then selects a predefined question to ask Copilot. Copilot's response might resemble the following example:

> The top 10 most significant changes contributing to the change in demand are:
>
> 1. Car Audio Unit-500 in Distribution center increased by 31% or 208 units.
> 1. Car Audio Unit-65-Black in Distribution center increased by 31% or 173 units.
> 1. Car Audio Unit-65-Silver in Store 2 increased by 29% or 574 units.
> 1. Mid-Range Speaker in Store 1 increased by 29% or 509 units.
> 1. High End Speaker in Store 4 increased by 28% or 298 units.
> 1. High End Speaker in Store 1 increased by 28% or 351 units.
> 1. Car Audio Unit-65-Silver in Store 1 increased by 28% or 405 units.
> 1. High End Cabinet-Oak in Distribution center increased by 28% or 190 units.
> 1. Car Audio Unit-500 in Store 4 increased by 28% or 123 units.
> 1. Car Audio Unit-200 in Store 1 increased by 27% or 240 units.
