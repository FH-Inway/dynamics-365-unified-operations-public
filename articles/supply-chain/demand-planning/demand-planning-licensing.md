- For complete licensing details for all Dynamics 365 products, including Supply Chain Management and Demand planning, see the [Dynamics 365 Licensing Guide](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkId=866544).
- For links to licensing and pricing details for all Dynamics 365 applications, see the [Dynamics 365 pricing overview](https://www.microsoft.com/dynamics-365/pricing-overview).

After purchasing the required licenses, an administrator must assign one to each user that needs it. For details about how to assign licenses to users, see [Assign licenses](/power-platform/admin/assign-licenses) and [Assign or unassign licenses for users in the Microsoft 365 admin center](/microsoft-365/admin/manage/assign-licenses-to-users).
