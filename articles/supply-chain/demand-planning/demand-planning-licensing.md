# Demand planning license requirements

[!include [banner](../includes/banner.md)]

To use Demand planning in Microsoft Dynamics 365 Supply Chain Management in a production environment, each relevant user must have a license for it.

- For licensing options and pricing details, see [Dynamics 365 pricing](https://dynamics.microsoft.com/pricing/).
- After purchasing the required licenses, an administrator must assign one to each user that needs it. For details about how to assign licenses to users, see [Assign licenses](/power-platform/admin/assign-licenses) and [Assign or unassign licenses for users in the Microsoft 365 admin center](/microsoft-365/admin/manage/assign-licenses-to-users).
