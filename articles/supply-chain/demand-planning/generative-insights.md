*Generative insights* offers detailed insights calculated using AI models. It currently supports two metrics: *seasonality* and *signal correlation*. The system clusters forecast data based on distinct patterns found for each metric.

Visual displays make it easy for planners to understand time series data and make business decisions based on it. Information is clustered (grouped) according to the detected patterns. For each cluster, generative insights provide a confidence score and describe the pattern in natural language. The system also indicates the proportion of planning items that follow the pattern.

To view generative insights, follow these steps:

1. Open the time series that you want to analyze. For example, on the navigation pane, select **Planning data** \> **Forecasts**, and then select the time series.
1. The **Generative insights** section appears near the top of the page. Do one of the following steps:
    - If you've never generated insights for the current time series, then select the **Generate insights** button available here. The system then runs the AI model to generate insights for the current time series. The process might take a few minutes, depending on the size of the time series.
    - If you have generated insights for the current time series, then summarized results are already shown. There's also a **Regenerate** button to regenerate the insights, which is useful if you've updated the time series since the last time you generated insights for it.

1. When insights are available, they are summarized in the **Generative insights** section (you might need to expand the section to see them). There are two tiles here:
    - **Insights detection** – Shows how many of each type of insight was detected in the time series.
    - **Summary** – Summarizes the insights that were detected.

1. In the **Insight detection** tile, select **View insights** to see the details. Depending on what was detected, the system shows one or more of the following:
    - Several graphs of relevant data. Select any of these graphs to drill down to a larger view.
    - A confidence score that indicates how confident the system is about each detected insight.
    - Various relevant KPI values for each insight.
    - A description of each insight, which is written in natural language. This description typically explains the detected pattern and its significance.
    - Some detailed graphs provide both a timeline view and data grid. Hover the mouse pointer to read timeline values. Select a row in the grid to add that row to the graph.
    - Some detailed graphs provide a dimension breakdown that lets you review the major contributors to the detected insights. For example, you can see which products or locations contributed most to the detected seasonality or signal correlation.

1. When you're done exploring the insights, select **Back to time series** to return to the time series.
