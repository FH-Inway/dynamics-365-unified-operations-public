# Limit automatic time series updates with time freezes

[!include [banner](../includes/banner.md)]

<!-- KFM: This is based on a copy of the time fence article with freeze pasted in everywhere. Careful review needed. -->

*Time freezes* let demand planning managers define rules that prevent the system from automatically updating selected cells in existing time series when a forecast gets recalculated, such as when you use [rolling forecasts](rolling-forecasts.md) or when you manually rerun a forecast to update an existing time series. Time freezes are similar to [time fences](time-fences.md), which are used to prevent users from *manually* editing certain time series values. However, time freezes only prevent *automated* updates that would otherwise occur when you rerun a forecast; users can still edit those values manually in the time series.

Unlike time fences (which apply to all time series that match the time fence logic), you must explicitly configure each relevant *Forecast* and *Forecast with signals* step to use the time freezes that should apply to it. You can assign any number of time freezes to each step, and you can also assign no time freezes at all. If you don't assign any time freezes to a step, then the step doesn't use any time freeze rules.

For example, the system might be prevented from updating specific forecast values that fall within the next three months. However, the system can still update values for the previous month or for four months from now. Time freezes use the bucket size of the time series to establish a time span that starts in the current period and extends a fixed number of periods into the future.

Time freezes are defined as logical expressions. For example, you could create a time freeze that lasts two months and applies to product ID *K0001* in color *Red*. The rule would then apply for all *Forecast* and *Forecast with signals* steps that have that time freeze assigned.

## Manage time freezes

To view, create, edit, or delete a time freeze, follow these steps.

1. On the navigation pane, select **Configuration** \> **Time freezes**.

    The **Active time freeze rules** page shows a list of active time freezes. For each time freeze, you can review the name, conditions, and other settings.

1. Follow one or more of these steps as required:

    - To create a new time freeze, select **New** on the Action Pane.
    - To edit an existing time freeze, select the link in the **Name** column.
    - To delete a time freeze, select the row for it, and then, on the Action Pane, select **Delete**.
    - To view and edit deactivated time freezes, select the **Active time freeze rules** heading, and then select **Inactive time freeze rules** in the dropdown list. Other views are also available here, including views for viewing only daily, monthly, or weekly time freeze rules. <!-- KFM: No longer true? On my Aurora build, these do nothing and inactive time fences are shown in the Active time fence rules view. Remove this? -->

1. If you chose to edit a time freeze in the previous step, a tabbed window appears. If you choose to create a new time freeze, then a wizard launches, which offers similar settings. On the **Summary** edit tab (or **Get started** wizard page), set the following fields:

    - **Name** – Enter a name for the time freeze.
    - **Description** – Enter a short description of the time freeze.
    - **Owner** – Select the user account that owns the time freeze record.
    - **Active** – Select whether the time freeze should be active. Inactive time freezes have no effect, even when explicitly assigned to step. (This option is only shown on the **Summary** edit tab. In the wizard, you can set this option on the **Review and finish** page.)

1. On the **Conditions** edit tab (or **Add conditions** wizard page), define the conditions under which the time freeze applies. Use the **Add condition** and **Delete** (trashcan) buttons to add or remove rows as required. The rows are combined by using an *AND* operator. Therefore, the time freeze locks only cells where the condition in *every* row is true. For each row, set the following fields:

    - **Table** – Select the data table that provides the cell value to compare.
    - **Column** – For the selected table, select the column that provides the cell value to compare.
    - **Operator** – Select the logic to apply to test the cell value against the row value. For example, select *equals*, *greater than*, or *less than*. There is also a *Select all* operator, which matches all values in the column (learn more in [Using the select all operator](time-fences.md#select-all)).
    - **Value** – Enter a comma-separated list of values to compare the cell value to. You can either select among available values in a dropdown list or enter custom values. If you specify more than one value, the values are combined by using an *OR* operator. Therefore, the condition in the row is true for every time series cell that matches any one of the specified values. The **Value** field is disabled when you use the *Select all* operator.

1. On the **Time freeze horizon** edit tab or wizard page, define the time span that the time freeze applies to. The time span always starts in the time bucket that includes the current date. It then extends a fixed number of time buckets into the future. Set the following fields:

    - **Time buckets** – Specify the size of the time buckets that you want to use to define the time span. The time freeze applies only to forecast profiles that also use this time bucket size. The system doesn't convert between time bucket sizes. For example, if you select *Monthly* here, your rule will have no effect if used in a forecast profile that uses *Weekly* time buckets (even though a month is about four weeks long). <!-- KFM: This explanation requires review. -->
    - **Current period +** – Specify the total number of time buckets, after the current one, to include in the time freeze. The time freeze always applies to the current time bucket. Therefore, if you want to include only the current time bucket in the time freeze, set this field to *0* (zero). To include only the current time bucket and the next one, set this field to *1*.

    The **Example** area shows the time freeze that results from your settings on this page.

1. On the **Review and finish** wizard page (which isn't shown when you edit an existing time freeze), review the settings that you made in the previous steps and set the **Active** option as needed. If everything looks correct, select **Review and Finish** to create the time freeze.

## Add a time freeze to a forecast profile

As mentioned, you must explicitly configure each relevant *Forecast* and *Forecast with signals* step to use the time freezes that should apply to it. To do this, follow these steps:

1. Create the time freeze record that you want to use, as described in the previous sections of this article.
1. Create or open a relevant forecast profile as described in [Work with forecast profiles](forecast-profiles.md).
1. On the **Forecast model** tab, crate or select the step that you want to add a time freeze to. The step must be a *Forecast* or *Forecast with signals* step. (Learn more in [Design forecast models](design-forecast-models.md).) If you're editing an existing step, open the **Actions** menu for the step and then select **Settings**.
1. Use the **Time freeze rules** field to search for and select the time freeze that you want to apply to the step. You can select multiple time freezes if needed. <!-- KFM: We should maybe describe what happens when you use more than one time freeze (what is the combination logic?)-->
