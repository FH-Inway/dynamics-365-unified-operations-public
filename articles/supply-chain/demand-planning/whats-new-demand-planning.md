# What's new or changed in Demand planning

## Version 1.0.0.1182

### New fixes and improvements in version 1.0.0.1182

This version of Demand planning introduces the following fixes and improvements:

- Each organization instance can now run up to five forecasts in parallel. Newly created forecasts will only run in parallel provided all existing forecast jobs have already started (in the *Executing* state). If one or more existing forecast jobs are still waiting to start (in the *Created* state) when a new forecast is created, then all forecasts will be executed sequentially.
