## <a name="enhancements"></a>Feature enhancements included in this release

The following table lists the feature enhancements that are included in this release. Each of these enhancements provides an incremental improvement to an existing feature. Because they're only enhancements, they aren't listed in the [release plan](/dynamics365/release-plan/2024wave2/finance-supply-chain/dynamics365-supply-chain-management/planned-features). However, to ensure that these enhancements won't conflict with your existing customizations or preferences, each of them is turned off by default (unless otherwise noted).

Some of these features aren't visible on your system until you turn them on in [feature management](../../fin-ops-core/fin-ops/get-started/feature-management/feature-management-overview.md) using the name listed here for the *Feature management name* (additional configuration may also be needed). Features that don't show a feature management name are visible by default as of this version of Supply Chain Management, but typically add a new configuration option that you need to set to use the new functionality.

| Feature enhancement | Description |
|---|---|
|<p>**Module:** Asset management</p><p>**Feature management name:** *Print work order document attachments*</p> | Lets you print work order reports that include PDF documents attached to work order headers and lines. |
|<p>**Module:** Inventory and warehouse management</p><p>**Feature management name:** *(Preview) Inventory dimensions with license plate id cleanup*</p> | Adds the ability to clean up inventory dimensions with license plate IDs that are more than one year old, are financial updated, and have no on-hand inventory. |
|<p>**Module:** Master planning</p><p>**Feature management name:** *Enable the calculation of Batch CTP even when plan run ends with errors.*</p> | Allows for CTP-confirmed dates to be calculated for sales order lines, even when the Planning Optimization run ends with errors. Confirmed dates will be calculated for sales order lines that didn't have any errors. To enable or disable this behavior, use the **Calculate Batch CTP even with errors** setting in the plan settings for the dynamic plan. |
|<p>**Module:** Production control</p><p>**Feature management name:** *Add filter to hide completed jobs on the Kanban board*</p> | Adds a **Hide completed jobs** checkbox to the Kanban board. The option lets you choose to hide all completed jobs, which provides a cleaner and more focused view. |
|<p>**Module:** Procurement and sourcing</p><p>**Feature management name:** *Choose whether to consolidate sales orders for direct deliveries*</p> | Makes it possible to choose whether the *Create direct delivery orders* batch job should consolidate qualifying sales orders into a single purchase order when creating a direct delivery. You can control this behavior using the new **Consolidate sales orders for direct deliveries** setting on the **Delivery** tab of the **Procurement and sourcing parameters** page. When you enable this feature, the system defaults to not consolidating qualifying sales orders, which is different from the previous behavior. Previously, the batch job always consolidated qualifying sales orders. |
|<p>**Module:** Procurement and sourcing</p><p>**Feature management name:** *Enable purch parameters to control delivery information sync on sales and purchase orders*</p> | Controls the creating and updating of the **Delivery mode** and **Delivery terms** fields on purchase orders. The new parameters are added for stock and direct delivery scenarios. |
|<p>**Module:** Sales and marketing</p><p>**Feature management name:** *Price and discount search for derived line creation*</p> | Adds the ability to search for new prices in trade agreements for derived intercompany sales orders and sales order lines. |
| <p>**Module:** Warehouse management</p><p>**Enhancement:** *Container label printing improvement*</p><p>**Feature management name:** *(None)*</p> | <p>The system now allows printing of container labels when closing a container.</p><p>Learn more in [Container label layouts and printing](../warehousing/print-container-labels.md).</p> |
| <p>**Module:** Warehouse management</p><p>**Enhancement:** *Custom label layout data source parameters*</p><p>**Feature management name:** *(None)*</p> | <p>On a custom label layout data source, it's now possible to define parameters that the user can specify when printing labels. These parameters can be then used in label layouts in addition to values retrieved from table records, for example, to specify a quantity of labels to print.</p><p>Learn more in [Custom label layouts and printing](../warehousing/custom-label-layouts-and-printing.md)</p> |
| <p>**Module:** Warehouse management</p><p>**Enhancement:** *Dynamic printer selection improvements*</p><p>**Feature management name:** *(None)*</p> | <p>Lets you assign default printers to specific mobile devices.</p><p>Learn more in [Dynamic printer selection](../warehousing/dynamic-printing-selection.md).</p> |
| <p>**Module:** Warehouse management</p><p>**Enhancement:** *Load packing slip posting*</p><p>**Feature management name:** *(None)*</p> | <p>Introduces the capability to execute the sales order packing slip procedure as background batch tasks, which is triggered according to the data associated with warehouse loads.</p><p>Learn more in [Load packing slip posting](../warehousing/outbound-load-handling.md#load-packing-slip-posting).</p> |
| <p>**Module:** Warehouse management</p><p>**Enhancement:** *Location directives Locate by `ASN` for Transfer receipt*</p><p>**Feature management name:** *(None)*</p> | <p> Introduces the capability to put all the items on a license plate in one location and prevents the system from making you split the items into different locations for ASN (license plate receiving) of transfer orders. </p><p>Learn more in [Location directives using locate by ASN](../warehousing/create-location-directive.md#locate-by).</p> |
| <p>**Module:** Warehouse management</p><p>**Enhancement:** *New fields and sorting on the warehouse transactions page*</p><p>**Feature management name:** *(None)*</p> | <p>The **Warehouse transactions** page now includes more fields that show information and provide opportunities for sorting and filtering the page. The new fields are **Transaction time** and **Warehouse inventory transaction mechanism**. The **Transaction time** field displays the actual time for *Warehouse-specific inventory transactions*, but only indicates the date for *Inventory transactions*. By default, the page sorts by **Transaction time** and record ID to reflect the order in which the transactions were created.</p><p>Learn more in [Warehouse-specific inventory transactions](../warehousing/warehouse-transactions.md).</p> |

- A *deprecated* feature isn't in active development and may be removed in a future update.
