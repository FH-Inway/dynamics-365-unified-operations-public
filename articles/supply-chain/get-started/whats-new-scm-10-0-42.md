## <a name="enhancements"></a>Feature enhancements included in this release

The following table lists the feature enhancements that are included in this release. Each of these enhancements provides an incremental improvement to an existing feature. Because they're only enhancements, they aren't listed in the [release plan](/dynamics365/release-plan/2024wave2/finance-supply-chain/dynamics365-supply-chain-management/planned-features). However, to ensure that these enhancements won't conflict with your existing customizations or preferences, each of them is turned off by default (unless otherwise noted).

Some of these features aren't visible on your system until you turn them on in [feature management](../../fin-ops-core/fin-ops/get-started/feature-management/feature-management-overview.md) using the name listed here for the *Feature management name* (additional configuration may also be needed). Features that don't show a feature management name are visible by default as of this version of Supply Chain Management, but typically add a new configuration option that you need to set to use the new functionality.

| Feature enhancement | Description |
|---|---|
| <p>**Module:** Master planning</p><p>**Feature management name:** *Include invoiced and delivered orders during supply and demand forecast reduction for planning optimization*</p> | Include invoiced and delivered orders during supply and demand forecast reduction for Planning Optimization. Invoiced demand accounts for picked, packed, and invoiced issues. Delivered supplies accounts for registered, received, and delivered receipts. This only applies to products with a coverage group that has a reduction key specified, and the master plan must reduce forecast by transactions in period. |
| <p>**Module:** Product information management</p><p>**Feature management name:** *(Preview) Rename item number*</p> | This feature was released as a preview but was never made generally available for use in production environments. It was [removed from the product](removed-deprecated-features-scm-updates.md) in version 10.0.44 and shouldn't be used with any version of Supply Chain Management. |
| <p>**Module:** Production control</p><p>**Feature management name:** *Allow to select validation logic for expiration of raw materials: either against planned consumption date or production order delivery date*</p> | Adds a new option for validating batch expiration dates when reserving a batch of raw material to be used during production. It adds a new value, *Raw material date of production bill of material (BOM) or formula line*, to the **Validate batch expiration on** drop-down list on the **Item model groups** page. When this value is selected, the system validates the batch expiration date against the raw material date found on the production BOM or formula lines. |
| <p>**Module:** Production control</p><p>**Feature management name:** *Set the desired status on selected jobs in report progress list view in the production floor execution interface*</p> | Workers reporting job progress from the production floor execution interface can now select the desired status on multiple jobs in the report-progress list view. |
| <p>**Module:** Production control</p><p>**Feature management name:** *Streamlined registration process for indirect activities on the Production floor execution*</p> | Streamlines the process for workers to register for indirect activities through the production floor execution interface. Previously, when a worker registered for an indirect activity, a dialog box would open, asking them whether they wanted to stop the activity or log it at the end of their shift. This feature removes the dialog. Instead, the system automatically adds the indirect activity to the worker's active job list. The system stops the indirect activity when the worker begins a new task (such as a production job), another indirect activity, or a project job. |

## Preview features that are now generally available

The following table lists the features that were introduced as public preview features in a previous version and became generally available in version 10.0.42. As with other new features, most of these features are turned off by default, so you must turn them on in [Feature management](../../fin-ops-core/fin-ops/get-started/feature-management/feature-management-overview.md) if you want to use them.

| Module | Feature name | More information |

| Inventory and warehouse management | *Inventory Visibility integration with inventory adjustment posting* | [Enable Inventory Visibility for Commerce](../inventory/inventory-visibility-commerce-enable.md)<br><br>[What's new or changed in Dynamics 365 Supply Chain Management 10.0.34 (July 2023)](whats-new-scm-10-0-34.md) |
| Inventory and warehouse management | *Inventory Visibility integration with inventory adjustment offset* | [Inventory Visibility adjustment offset](../inventory/inventory-visibility-adjustment-offset.md)<br><br>[Enable Inventory Visibility for Commerce](../inventory/inventory-visibility-commerce-enable.md)<br><br>[Sync external inventory adjustments through Inventory Visibility](../inventory/inventory-visibility-sync-changes.md)<br><br>[What's new or changed in Dynamics 365 Supply Chain Management 10.0.34 (July 2023)](whats-new-scm-10-0-34.md) |

## New and updated documentation resources

We have recently added or significantly updated the following help articles. These articles aren't necessarily related to the new features that were added for this release, as listed in the previous sections. However, they might help you get more out of existing features.

| Feature area | New or updated articles |
|---|---|
| Master planning | [Calculate sales order delivery dates using CTP](../master-planning/planning-optimization/calculate-delivery-dates-using-ctp.md) now describes *Near real-time CTP* and *Improve Planning Optimization performance by merging and queueing plan regeneration jobs* functionality. |

### Removed and deprecated Supply Chain Management features

The [Removed or deprecated features in Dynamics 365 Supply Chain Management](removed-deprecated-features-scm-updates.md) article describes features that have been or are scheduled to be removed or deprecated for Supply Chain Management.

- A *removed* feature is no longer available in the product.
- A *deprecated* feature isn't in active development and may be removed in a future update.

Before any feature is removed from the product, the deprecation notice will be announced in the [Removed or deprecated features in Dynamics 365 Supply Chain Management](removed-deprecated-features-scm-updates.md) article 12 months prior to the removal.

For breaking changes that only affect compilation time, but are binary compatible with sandbox and production environments, the deprecation time will be less than 12 months. Typically, these are functional updates that need to be made to the compiler.
