> The Pricing management module has been deprecated and will be removed in a future release. It is replaced by the [Unified pricing management module](/dynamics365/supply-chain/unified-pricing-management/upm-pricing-management-overview), which offers nearly all of the same functionality as the deprecated Pricing management module, plus several important enhancements. Both the deprecated pricing management module and the Unified pricing management module use similar or identical navigation paths in the Supply Chain Management user interface, so only one of these modules can be active at a time. As of Supply Chain Management version 10.0.41, if you never enabled the deprecated pricing management module in your environment, only the Unified pricing management module will be available to you. If you have enabled the deprecated pricing management module, you can continue to use it until it is removed, but we recommend that you transition to the Unified pricing management module as soon as possible to take advantage of the new features and enhancements that it offers. For help transitioning from the deprecated pricing management module to the Unified pricing management module, please contact Microsoft Support.
