Corrective and preventive action (CAPA) management lets you create and maintain records of the actions taken to manage and resolve non-conformities or defects. By planning, tracking, and analyzing CAPA cases, you can develop efficient processes that can also help to resolve similar issues. CAPA management provides for a formal and controlled process for managing various types of issues arising from manufacturing, engineering, quality, or data quality sources.

CAPA management:

- Implements a case management infrastructure to identify, correct, and prevent future problems.
- Leads to corrective and/or preventive actions.
- Provides a tool to drive continuous improvement
- Provides a closed-loop system that meets current Good Manufacturing Practice (cGMP) requirements and U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) expectations, which mandate a repeatable, systematic failure investigation and root cause analysis.

CAPA management in Supply Chain Management lets you capture issues and investigate, evaluate, and determine the root cause or causes of each problem so you can find a solution and decide how best to implement it. CAPA management allows you to capture and track corrective and preventive actions and then monitor and review their effectiveness. It provides features that automate the process to help drive continuous improvement. This approach supports the core disciplines for various quality standards such as Six Sigma and ISO-9000. The solution is role-based, supports electronic records and electronic signatures, and is fully compliant with FSA Title 21 CFR Part 11 regulations.

Supply Chain Management CAPA management features provide:

- Unlimited and flexible CAPA processes – A CAPA process is a user-defined list of activities that must be executed to bring a CAPA case to a satisfactory conclusion.
- A workflow-driven process – CAPA work is assigned by the system automatically based on how your CAPA processes and CAPA worker groups are defined.
- Flexible assignment of activities – Associate specific users or groups with each part of a CAPA process.
- Integration with Outlook – When work is assigned, the system can automatically send emails to notify the appropriate user that works needs their attention.
- Create CAPA cases at the point of need – CAPA cases can be created at the point of need in the system by the person who first recognizes that there is a problem that needs attention. The system automatically links each CAPA case to the record from which it was created (for example, to the specific customer, quality order, or production order that was open when the case was created).
- Trending analysis – The CAPA workspace provides analytical tools to help you analyze CAPA trends.

The following table describes tasks that employees can perform when they work with CAPA management.

| Task | Description |
|--|--|
| **Create a CAPA case** | Create a new CAPA case record for a customer, vendor, product, or employee. |
| **Work with a CAPA case** | Add detailed information to a new or existing CAPA case, such as activities. |
| **Update the status of a CAPA case** | Update the status of a CAPA case, for example from *Opened* to*In process*. |
| **Update the stage of a CAPA case** | Update the stage in the process of working a CAPA case, for example from *Evaluation* to*Investigation*. |
| **Close a CAPA case** | Change the status of an *Opened* case to *Closed* to indicate that the issue has been resolved. |
| **Rank a knowledge article** | Rank a knowledge article to indicate if it was successful in helping to close a case. |
