# Customer specific certificate of analysis

A Certificate of Analysis (COA) is a document provided to customers who require documentation of items they purchase. The COA describes specific tests performed to confirm the quality of a given item lot. It should list tests performed, the tolerance/outcome allowed for each test, results of the tests on a sample of that item lot, and lot expiration date.

Supply Chain Management provides the ability to create a basic Certificate of Analysis from the quality order or from the menu directly after selecting a quality order. On the Test group, there is a flag on the test to indicate whether that test should be included on the COA. There is currently no ability to vary the content of the COA by customer and there is no ability to automatically create/print a COA at sales order packing slip posting time.

The Customer specific Certificate of analysis feature addresses some of the gaps in the current COA feature. The new feature has the following main components:

- A way to group customers for COA-related purposes and set up COA customer requirements on Test groups and Quality orders.

- Setup and support application of COA Customer requirements by Customer/Group/All:

    - Include/Exclude by test

    - Use Customer-specific min/max ranges

    - Suppress min/max values

    - Replace actual pass/fail test results with standard verbiage

- Optionally, print independent batch attributes and their values

- Setup and support application of COA Customer requirements by Customer/Group/All for:

    - From Quality order manually

    - From Sales order packing slip post automatically

    - From Inventory batch manually

    - From Inventory management menu directly

- Visibility to additional details on the COA Report

## Setting up and maintaining Customer COA requirements

Customers can be grouped for COA purposes by assigning the customer to a COA Customer group. COA customer groups can be created from this menu path: Inventory management** \> **Setup** \> **Certificate of analysis** \> **COA Customer group. Customers can be added to a given group from this form or from the customer directly.

On a given test group, by quality test, customer COA requirements can be defined for all customers, a COA customer group or specific customers. When setting up these requirements, the user can specify whether given tests can be excluded from the COA, if minimum and maximum values should be suppressed, if customer specific batch attribute ranges should be printed instead of standard ranges and / or if actual test results, pass or fail, should be replaced with standard verbiage instead of actual results.

Once the customer COA requirements are established on the test group, the requirements will default to all quality orders that use that test group, but the requirements can be modified on the quality order directly. In the example below, if the COA was printed for Customer US-002, T1 would not be included. For all customers in COA-CG1, when the COA was generated for one of them, this test would be included, customer specific batch attribute range would be used, if available, instead of the standard range and if the test passed, the actual result would be replaced with the verbiage: Within spec.

## Using Customer COA requirements

The customer COA requirements will be utilized whenever a customer specific COA is generated. A customer specific COA can be generated from the Inventory management menu, a Quality order, an Inventory batch, or automatically from the Sales order Packing slip process. From the menu, a specific quality order, or a specific Inventory batch, the customer specific COA will be triggered by the user choosing a customer account for the COA. Once a customer account is selected and the print option is chosen, the system will automatically look at the customer COA requirements for the specific customer selected and the details of the COA will be adjusted based on the specific requirements for that customer. Standard print destination options are available such as printing the COA to the screen, printer, file or email. If the standard COA is desired, then no customer account should be selected. This will trigger the system to generate the standard COA and the Customer COA requirements will not be utilized. When generating COA's from the Packing slip posting process, only customer specific COA's are generated for all item/batch combinations on the sales orders that have quality orders identified. The default print destination from this process is defined on the Inventory management parameters under Print Management for Customer specific COA's. The chart below identifies multiple ways to access the COA.

| **<u>Options</u>** | **<u>Menu path</u>** | **<u>Helpful hints</u>** |
|-------------------------|-------------------------|-------------------------|
| Menu directly | Inventory management** \> **Inquiries** \> **Quality management** \> **Certificate of analysis | Can print both the Standard COA and Customer-specific COA (triggered by selecting a specific customer account). Must select a quality order in both cases. |
| Quality order | Inventory management** \> **Periodic** \> **Quality management** \> **Quality order</br>Ribbon: Inquiries** \> **Certificate of analysis | Can print both the Standard COA and Customer-specific COA (triggered by selecting a specific customer account). Since access is from a quality order, the Quality order is assumed in both cases. |
| Inventory batch | Inventory management** \> **Inquiries&gt; Dimensions** \> **Batches</br>Ribbon: Inquiries** \> **Certificate of analysis | Can print both the Standard COA and Customer-specific COA (triggered by selecting a specific customer account). Since access is from an inventory batch, the Certificate of analysis Quality order (found on the General tab) on the Inventory Batch is used in both cases to generate the COA. If the Certificate of analysis quality order needs to be updated, the ribbon action "Reset COA Quality order" can be used to change the quality order that drives the details of the COA.</br>Note: This option, including generating the standard COA from here, is new functionality only available with Supply Chain Management. |
| Sales order packing slip post process | <u>For individual sales order:</u></br>Sales and marketing** \> **Common** \> **Sales orders** \> **All sales orders</br>Ribbon: Pick and pack** \> **Generate** \> **Packing slip</br><u>For multiple sales orders:</u></br>Sales and marketing** \> **Periodic** \> **Sales update** \> **Packing slip</br>(Add new orders to the list, select the checkbox to Print customer specific Certificate of analysis.) | Only customer specific COA's are printed from this process. Based on the customer placing the order, the system will print a customer specific COA for every item/batch combination on the order that has a Certificate of analysis Quality order specified on the Batch. No COA will be printed for items not batch-controlled or for items where the batch does not have a Quality order specified.</br>Note: The option to Print Customer specific COA is initially defaulted from the Accounts Receivable parameters from the Updates tab. This parameter will default to new customers. The checkbox on the Packing slip process form will default from the customer if processing for a single order. If processing for multiple orders, this checkbox will need to be selected if printing customer specific COA's are desired. |

## Printing Customer specific COA

Customer specific COA's can be adjusted based on the customer and will include more information than what is included on the standard COA. The customer COA requirements for the specific customer will drive details such as whether a specific test should be included, if minimum/maximum values should be suppressed, if customer-specific batch attribute ranges should be used instead of the standard range and if results should be replaced with standard verbiage. In addition, customer specific COA's provide a specific customer section on the report which includes Customer name, description, and contact information. Product and Tracking dimensions will also be included as well as batch dates such as Batch expiration date and Best Before Batch Date. Optionally, customer specific COA's can include independent batch attributes and their values. These are batch attributes associated to the batch that were not specifically tested on the quality order in question but are still important details about the quality of the product. There is a parameter on the Batch attribute (Include on COA independent of quality order) that will default to the Batch attribute by product if the batch attribute should be included in the independent batch attribute section of the COA if not specifically tested on the quality order. If the Customer specific COA was generated automatically from the Sales Order Packing slip process, the Sales order number and packing slip date will also display on the report. Here is an example of the Customer specific COA requested from a quality order for Customer US-027. Notice that the Customer COA requirements were used. For example, for Test T1, the actual test result was suppressed and replaced with the standard verbiage: Within spec. Also notice the Customer details section and the independent batch attribute section. These are only available on customer specific COA's.
