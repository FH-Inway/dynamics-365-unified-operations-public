# Quick Results Entry

Entering test results for all tests included on a Quality order can be cumbersome and time consuming. This feature has drastically enhanced the user interface to enter in test results for a quality order. The new Quick results entry option on the Quality order presents the data for all tests consolidated on one form, with defaulted quantities based on the Quality order quantity and informational details about minimum, maximum and target values for each test on the Quality order.

## Using Quick Result Entry

When entering results for quality order tests, the standard form can be used. This is accessible from the Results ribbon option on the quality order line. Alternatively, the Quick results entry ribbon option can be selected from the quality order header. Additionally, notice a new field on the Quality order line test grid at the bottom for "Test results exist". This field reflects whether test results have already been entered for the appropriate test line.

Notice here the difference between the two forms. On the Left is the standard Results form. It is just for one test and does not include information related to Standard, Minimum and Maximum values for the test. The Result quantity needs to be entered for every row on this form. On the Right is the Quick results entry form. It has consolidated all the tests on one form plus it includes visibility to the Standard, Minimum and Maximum test ranges for informational purposes. The Result quantity (or the Result CW quantity if the item is a Catch Weight item) is defaulted for you from the quality order quantity. The Test results can quickly be entered down the Test result column for the entire Quality order without ever leaving the form.

The Quick results entry form supports five different ribbon actions. The New and the Delete options allow the Quality order quantity to be separated out and results entered for different quantities. For example, if the quality order quantity is 5, then using the New action, a total of five lines can be entered for that test so that a different test result can be entered for each quantity. The sum of the quantities for each test must still equal the total quantity of the quality order. The Validate ribbon action, performs the required validation for the selected line and determines if the line is a pass or a fail. The Reset test results ribbon action eliminates the test result value for the given line and deselects the checkbox on the test line for Test results exist if no other line for that test has test results entered. The Split ribbon option provides the ability to take the selected line and split it into multiple lines.

There are two Split options provided. The Single line split option will take the selected line and create two lines where the sum of the quantities matches the total quantity on the selected line. For example, if the line quantity was 8 and a Split quantity of 3 is entered, the result will be two lines, one with quantity of 3 and one with a quantity of 5. Different test results can then be entered for both lines.

The second Split option is Multiple lines split. This can be used to quickly create rows with the same test quantity. The Result quantity per line needs to be entered. The system then will determine the Total number of results lines based on the result quantity per line. For example, if the current line has a quantity of 8 and the Result quantity per line entered is 2, the system will automatically create 4 lines where there was one, each with a quantity of 2. If the number is not even, the system will do as many rows as possible with the residual in the last row. For example, if the current line has a quantity of 8 and the Result quantity per line entered is 3, the system will create 3 result lines, two lines with the quantity of 3 and the 3rd line with the residual quantity of 2 for a total quantity of 8. Note: If the item is a CW item, CW quantity fields open on the split form to enter instead of the standard quantity fields.
