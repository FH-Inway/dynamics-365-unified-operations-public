# Manage CAPA cases

[!include [banner](../../includes/banner.md)]

Use corrective and preventive action (CAPA) cases to record, update, track, follow up on, and close issues that are raised by your customers, vendors, or employees.

## Create and view CAPA cases

You can create CAPA cases from many different pages in the system, including pages where you work with records from which CAPA cases might originate, such as customers, vendors, sales orders, purchase orders, return orders, and released products. When you create a CAPA case from a related or originating record, the case is linked to that record automatically. 

The following table shows how to create and view CAPA cases related to a selected customer, vendor, sales order, purchase order, return order, or released product.

| Record type | CAPA action | Action Pane tab | Action Pane group | Action Pane button |
|-------------|-------------|-----------------|-------------------|--------------------|
| Customers | Create a new CAPA case| **General** | **New** | **CAPA case** |
| Customers | View related CAPA cases | **General** | **Accounts** | **CAPA cases** |
| Vendors | Create a new CAPA case | **General** | **New** | **Create CAPA case** |
| Vendors | View related CAPA cases | **General** | **Accounts** | **CAPA cases** |
| Sales orders | Create a new CAPA case | **General** | **CAPA** | **Create CAPA case** |
| Sales orders | View related CAPA cases | **General** | **CAPA** | **View CAPA cases** |
| Purchase orders | Create a new CAPA case | **General** | **CAPA** | **Create CAPA case** |
| Purchase orders | View related CAPA cases | **General** | **CAPA** | **View CAPA cases** |
| Return orders | Create a new CAPA case | **General** | **New** | **Create CAPA case** |
| Return orders | View related CAPA cases | **General** | **New** | **View CAPA cases** |
| Released products | Create a new CAPA case | **General** | **Maintain CAPA cases** | **Create CAPA case** |
| Released products | View related CAPA cases | **General** | **Maintain CAPA cases** | **View CAPA cases** |

To view and work with all CAPA cases in the system, use one of the following navigation paths. You can also create new CAPA cases here.

- **Inventory management** \> **Periodic tasks** \> **CAPA management** \> **All CAPA cases**
- **Common** \> **Common** \> **CAPA management** \> **All CAPA cases**

To view and work only with the CAPA cases that you are responsible for, use one of the following navigation paths. You can also create new CAPA cases here.

- **Inventory management** \> **Periodic tasks** \> **CAPA management** \> **My CAPA cases**
- **Common** \> **Common** \> **CAPA management** \> **My CAPA cases**

To create a new CAPA case from the **All CAPA cases** or **My CAPA cases** page, do one of the following actions:

- To create a new, unlinked CAPA case, select **New** \> **CAPA case** on the Action Pane.
- To create a new CAPA case that is linked to a parent case, select the parent case on the grid and then select **New** \> **Dependent CAPA case** on the Action Pane.

Regardless of where you are when you create your new CAPA case, the **New CAPA case** dialog opens. Make the following settings on **General** tab of the dialog:

- **Name** – Enter or select a person's name from the global address book to associate with the CAPA case. If you started from a customer, vendor, sales order, purchase order, or return order, this is set automatically based on the record that was selected when you created the CAPA case.
- **Case ID** – The CAPA case identification number. This number is generated by the system.
- **Status** – Select the status of the CAPA case. The default status is *Opened*, which means it's not being worked on yet. You or the assigned worker should change it to *In process* when work begins on it.
- **Description** – Enter a short description of the CAPA case. This description is used to identify the case in lists and reports and is shown as the heading of the case when you open it.
- **Priority** – Select the CAPA case priority.
- **Parent case** – If you want to associate the case with another case, select the parent case here. This is set automatically if you chose a parent case when creating the current CAPA case.
- **CAPA category** – Select a category for the CAPA case.
- **CAPA subcategory** – If the category you selected has subcategories defined for it, then select one here.
- **Description** – Enter a brief description of the CAPA case.
- **Priority** – Select the CAPA case priority.
- **CAPA process** – Select the CAPA process that should be followed to resolve this case. The CAPA process defines a series of stages, which must be completed in order, and activities, which should be completed within each stage before continuing to the next one. The process is used to guide the workers who are assigned to the case through the steps needed to resolve it.

If you'd like to add a log entry to the case, open the **Case log** tab and enter the details of the log entry. You can view and add log entries from the details page for a CAPA case.

When you're done, select **OK** to create the case and open its details.
