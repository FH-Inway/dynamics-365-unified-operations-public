# Sample management reports and auditing (preview)

This section covers tools that support quality management through reporting, auditing, and procedural guidance. Reports provide insights into trends in test results for specific tests, helping to monitor quality performance over time. Audit trails track changes and actions for compliance and traceability. Sample procedures are step-by-step instructions that workers can access while processing samples through different life cycle states, ensuring consistency in activities such as collection and testing.

## Analyze sample test results

Reports provide visibility into how the results of a specific test evolve over time across multiple quality orders and samples for a given production or batch order. By analyzing these trends, you can identify patterns, monitor process stability, and detect potential quality issues early. This type of analysis can be performed for both inline sampling and continuous sampling, giving you flexibility to evaluate quality performance across different sampling strategies. These reports typically aggregate historical data for the selected test, allowing you to compare performance across different periods and make informed decisions for continuous improvement.

### Analyze inline sample results

To analyze sample test results for inline samples, follow these steps:

### Analyze continuous sample results

To analyze sample test results for continuous samples, follow these steps:

## Sample procedures 

Workers can access predefined procedures when working with samples. These procedures provide step-by-step guidance for different stages of sample handling, such as collecting samples and performing tests. By following these instructions, workers ensure that sampling and testing activities are carried out consistently and in compliance with defined quality standards.

To open a sample procedure follow these steps:

1. Create a batch or production order and inline samples as described in: [Initiate an inline sample (preview)](quality-sample-management-inline.md).
1. Make sure you have defined sample procedures and these are associated a sample association used for the production or batch order. Learn more about how to define sample procedures and sample associations in: [Enable and configure sample management (preview)](quality-sample-management-admin.md).
1. From the Action pane in the production order list page, select **Sample management workbench**.
1. From the Action pane, select **Sample procedures**.
