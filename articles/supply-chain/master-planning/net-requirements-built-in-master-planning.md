# Net requirements and pegging information with the deprecated master planning engine

[!include [banner](../includes/banner.md)]

When you run master planning, it's important that you understand its output, how existing supply covers the demand, and why specific supply was generated. You can use the **Net requirements** page to better understand the calculated requirements that master planning produces.

The **Net requirements** page shows the net requirements that are calculated for the product during master planning. It also shows the coverage settings that were applied during the master planning run, a breakdown of the requirement totals by transaction type, and pegging information.

The **Net requirements** page behaves slightly differently based on whether you're using Planning Optimization or the deprecated master planning engine. For more information about this difference, see [Differences between Planning Optimization and the deprecated master planning engine](planning-optimization/planning-optimization-differences-with-built-in.md)

For more information about how to work with this page, see [Net requirements and pegging information](planning-optimization/net-requirements.md).
