Create a product master for the predefined variants. The demo data company used to create this procedure is USMF. This procedure is intended for the product designer.

## Create a new product master

1. Go to **Product information management > Products > Product masters**.
2. Select **New**.
3. In the **Product number** field, type a value. The number must be unique. A number sequence can be set for the **Product number** field. In this case, the user doesn't have to enter a value.
4. In the **Product name** field, type a value. Enter a descriptive product name. The value defaults to the search name, but this can be changed by the user.
5. In the **Product dimension group** field, select the drop-down button to open the lookup. The product dimension group determines which of the four product dimensions that can be used to create product variants. This example uses a group with color and size.
6. In the list, find and select the desired record.
7. In the list, select the link in the selected row. The default **Configuration technology** is *Predefined variant*. This value is used for this example.
