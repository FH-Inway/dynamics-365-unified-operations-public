Exporting data for a product configuration model requires that you have at least one product model available. This procedure uses the High end speaker model in the demo company USMF to show you how to export data for this model.

1. Go to **Product information management \> Products \> Product configuration models**.
1. In the list, find and select the desired record.
    * Select the High end speaker model for this procedure.  
1. On the Action Pane, select **Model**.
1. Select **Export product model**.
    * The download behavior varies from browser to browser depending on how the security settings are set up.
