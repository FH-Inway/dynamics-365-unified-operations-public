## Capabilities

Supply Chain Management provides functionality that organizations can use to streamline and automate their source-to-pay processes. Icertis for Microsoft Dynamics 365 Supply Chain Management enhances this functionality by integrating capabilities for contract authoring, assembly, redlining, and analytics. This integration supports the following workflows:

- **Contract authoring** – Create procurement contracts and non-disclosure agreements (NDAs) by using configured attributes, templates, clauses, master data, and rules. You can use seeded configurations to get started right away, but configurations are always tailored to the needs of your business.
- **Reviews and negotiations** – Use preapproved legal templates and playbooks to review, redline, and approve contracts. After contract are approved, you can seamlessly send them for digital signature.
- **Post-execution workflows** – After a contract is executed, an associated purchase agreement is created in Supply Chain Management. The purchase agreement is created in an activated state, so that it can be used for operational purposes such as creating a release order and invoicing.
- **Update contracts** – You can amend an executed contract by using the same safeguards that are applied when new contracts are drafted. Additionally, contracts can be seamlessly terminated. In this case, the required due processes are followed.
- **Risk Assessment Copilot** – Risk Assessment Copilot significantly accelerates the contract review process. At the same time, it helps reduce risk by using AI to compare contract terms to a company's predefined risk parameters, based on the contract type.
- **Pre-seeded information** – Icertis for Microsoft Dynamics 365 Supply Chain Management includes extensive pre-seeded attributes and entities. Therefore, you can benefit from the integration without having to spend lots of time on implementation.

### Manage and operationalize procurement contracts

### Amend and update agreements

Icertis for Microsoft Dynamics 365 Supply Chain Management offers options that let you update or modify executed contracts. You can add line items, modify expiry dates, or terminate contracts. Updates to contracts can cause one of the following events:

- **Synchronize amendments** – The statuses of an Icertis procurement contract and the corresponding Supply Chain Management purchase agreements are regularly synced. Users can create amendments directly in Supply Chain Management. Contract managers can add an amendment to a signed or executed contract in Icertis. Downstream consumption then uses the revised information in Supply Chain Management.
- **Termination of contract** – If an Icertis procurement contract is terminated in Icertis Contract Intelligence (ICI), the associated purchase agreement in Supply Chain Management system is automatically terminated.
- **Reset expiry** – You can renew agreements or reset expiry dates as you require, based on your business needs.

### Integrate master data

All the previously mentioned workflows are enabled through the integration of master data that stores less frequently changing data and business information. The master data entity is based on attributes and rules. It can be reused for the various organizations that you work with.

### Comprehensive pre-seeded information for seamless integration

Icertis for Microsoft Dynamics 365 Supply Chain Management includes extensive pre-seeded attributes and entities. This pre-seeded information enables the application and integration to work seamlessly. It also lets users benefit from the integration after only minimal implementation time.

If configuration of the pre-seeded attributes and entities is required, an administrator or an implementation team can do it.

The pre-seeded information includes the following elements:

- Data models for procurement contracts, NDAs, line items, and associated documents
- Attributes that are part of contract types and master data
- Master data and rules
- Standard reports and saved searches
- Clauses and templates
- eSign configurations
- Role–action mappings
- Entities for notifications, reasons, organizations, cascade teams, and implementation tasks

### Risk Assessment Copilot

You can enhance the integration by adding Risk Assessment Copilot, which is powered by the Icertis ExploreAI Service. Risk Assessment Copilot significantly accelerates the contract review process. At the same, it helps reduce risk by using AI to compare contract terms to a company's predefined risk parameters, based on the contract type.
