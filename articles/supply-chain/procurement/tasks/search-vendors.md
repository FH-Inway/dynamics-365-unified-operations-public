# Search for vendors

[!include [banner](../../includes/banner.md)]

Learn how to search for vendors based on specific criteria. This example shows you how to search for vendors that are approved for a particular procurement category and have their primary address in a specific country/region. You can run this procedure in demo data company USMF, or on your own data. This task would usually be carried out by a procurement professional.

1. Go to **Procurement and sourcing** \> **Vendors** \> **Vendor search**.
2. Select the plus icon to open the **Procurement category selection** page.  
3. In the tree, select *CORP PROCUREMENT CATEGORIES\OFFICE MACHINES*. If you're running this procedure as a task guide, you might need to select the **Unlock** button before you can select the correct node. If you're not using USMF, select one of the categories that you have.  
4. Select **Add**. It's possible to select more than one category here. If you do so, the search finds all the vendors that are approved for at least one of the categories.  
5. Select **OK**.
6. In the **Country/region** field, type a value.
7. Select **OK**.
