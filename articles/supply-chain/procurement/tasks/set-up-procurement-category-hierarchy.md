This procedure shows you how to create new nodes in a procurement category hierarchy and how to configure a procurement category to be used in a procurement process.

3. On the Action Pane, select **New category node**. The system selects the top node by default.
4. In the **Name** field, type a value.
5. In the **Description** field, type a value.
6. In the **Friendly name** field, type a value. The friendly name is optional. It is displayed in category lookups together with the category name.  
7. Select **Save**.

## Add products to your new procurement category

1. Go to **Procurement and sourcing > Procurement categories**. Select the node you just added.
2. Toggle the expansion of the **Products** section.
3. Select **Add** to associate products with the procurement category.
