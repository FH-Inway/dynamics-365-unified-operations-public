# Production feedback

[!include [banner](../includes/banner.md)]

This article provides information about production feedback, which lets workers provide feedback about production jobs. The article includes information about the various ways that production feedback can be updated.

Production feedback gives workers the opportunity to provide feedback about production jobs. It lets workers record time and material consumption on production orders, operation quantities and status, and errors that cause a job or operation to fail. Production feedback can be updated in journals that are related to production orders. The **Production job card** and **Production route card** journals are used to report time and quantities per job or operation. For reporting about the last job or operation, quantities on the finished product can be reported as finished. 

Workers can also provide production feedback using the [production floor execution interface](production-floor-execution-use.md), which is part of the manufacturing execution functionality in the **Production control** module. The production floor execution interface has a configurable user interface that shows a list of the released jobs in a prioritized order for a selected work area. It also offers advanced options such as job bundling and team work. The production floor execution interface has a touch-optimized user interface. Feedback submitted through the production floor execution interface updates the production journals.
