A template bill of materials (BOM) can be attached to a service object relation. The service object relation can then be associated with either service orders or service agreements.

1.  Click **Service management** \> **Setup** \> **Service objects** \> **Service objects**.

2.  Select a service object.

3.  Click **Service agreements** or **Service orders** to display the service agreements or service orders that the service object has been associated with.

4.  Select a service agreement or a service order, click **Functions**, and then click **Attach template BOM**.

5.  Select the template BOM to attach to the object.


> [!TIP]
> <P>To move an attached BOM to another service object or to delete an attached BOM, in the <STRONG>Service objects</STRONG> form, click <STRONG>Functions</STRONG>, and then click <STRONG>Move service BOM</STRONG> or <STRONG>Delete service BOM</STRONG>.</P>
