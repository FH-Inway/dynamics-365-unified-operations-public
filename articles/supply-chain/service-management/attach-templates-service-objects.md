# Attach templates to service objects

[!include [banner](../includes/banner.md)]

A template bill of materials (BOM) can be attached to a service object relation. The service object relation can then be associated with either service orders or service agreements.

1. Go to **Service management** \> **Setup** \> **Service objects** \> **Service objects**.

2. Select a service object.

3. Select **Service agreements** or **Service orders** to display the service agreements or service orders that the service object has been associated with.

4. Select a service agreement or a service order, select **Functions**, and then select **Attach template BOM**.

5. Select the template BOM to attach to the object.

> [!TIP]
> To move an attached BOM to another service object or to delete an attached BOM, on the **Service objects** page, select **Functions**, and then select **Move service BOM** or **Delete service BOM**.
