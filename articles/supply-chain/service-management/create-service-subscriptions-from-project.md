[!include [banner](../includes/banner.md)]


You can create a service subscription from a project in **Project management and accounting**.

1.  Click **Project management and accounting** \> **Projects** \> **All projects**. Open the project that you want to create a subscription for.

2.  On the **Projects** form, on the **Action Pane**, on the **Manage** tab, click **Service** \> **Service subscription**.

3.  On the **Subscription** form, in the **Service subscription** field, enter a unique identification number. The project number is entered automatically into the subscription for the selected project.

4.  Enter the remaining information in the form.

You can now create subscription transactions for the subscription.


> [!NOTE]
> <P>If you have set up a number sequence for the subscription group, a subscription ID is generated automatically for the subscription when you specify the subscription group.</P>
