[!include [banner](../includes/banner.md)]

You can use service template groups to sort and filter service templates.

1. Click **Service management** \> **Setup** \> **Service agreements** \> **Service template groups**.
2. Create a new service template group.
3. Enter the group ID, a description, and a parent service template group, if there is one.
4. Save the service template group.
5. Set the **Tree control** slider to **Yes** to open the tree view and view the service template groups either as a hierarchy in a tree view or as an overview.
