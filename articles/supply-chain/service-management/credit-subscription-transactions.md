4.  From the **Fee transactions** form, select the transaction for which you want to create a credit note.

5.  Click **Functions** \> **Select for credit note**.

6.  From the **Select for credit note** form, select the transaction that you want to credit and then click **OK**.


> [!NOTE]
> <P>When you create the credit note, make sure that you select <STRONG>Credit notes</STRONG>. This is found in the <STRONG>Invoicing method</STRONG> list in the <STRONG>Create invoice</STRONG> dialog box.</P>

If the **Reverse accruals on crediting** field in the **Service management parameters** form is set to **Manual**, you have to reverse each accrued revenue transaction individually before you create a credit note proposal for the transaction.
