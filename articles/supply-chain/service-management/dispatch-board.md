[!include [banner](../includes/banner.md)]

A dispatch board is the central location from which you can view the status of activities in a service order. You can perform the following tasks in a dispatch board:

- Filter and view service activities in a certain date range.
- Identify the priority of a service activity, and distinguish among service priority levels based on a color scheme that you set up.
- Review the workers that are assigned to a dispatch team.
- Modify the service times and assigned technicians for a service activity.
- Review the list of service activities that have not been dispatched.

To work with the dispatch board, follow these steps.

1. Go to **Service management** \> **Perform periodic tasks** \> **Dispatch board**.
1. On the Action Pane, select **Adjust view settings** and then use the **Adjust view settings** dialog to select the date range and other options for the service activities you want to see.
1. In the grid, select the service activity you want to work with.
1. Navigate through the tabs in the bottom panel to view and modify the details of the selected service activity.
