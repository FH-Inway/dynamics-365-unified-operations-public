# Post arrival journal for returned products

[!include [banner](../includes/banner.md)]

To process a return, first validate the return quantity, update the quantity field in the item arrival journal. Then select a disposition code or indicate that the returned items have to be inspected. After completing these steps, you can post the item arrival journal for the return order.

1. Go to **Inventory management** \> **Periodic** \> **Arrival overview**.

1. In the **Setup name** filter, select **Return order**.

1. If the list of receipts is long, use the fields in the **Range** area to narrow the list.

1. Locate the line of the return order that you want to post, select its **Select for arrival** box, and then select **Start arrival**.

1. Go to **Journals** \> **Show arrivals from receipts** to open the **Location journal** page.

    > [!TIP]
    > To view detailed information, select a journal, and then select **Lines**.

1. Make any necessary updates, and then select **Post**.

After the journal is posted, the returned items are registered in inventory, and the **Return orders** form indicates that the items have arrived at the warehouse.
