# Service activities        

[!include [banner](../includes/banner.md)]


Create service activities to define and maintain tasks in a service order. A service order can include one or more service activities to be performed by a worker.

Service activities are defined in the **Activity types** form. (Click **Sales and marketing** \> **Setup** \> **Activities** \> **Activity types**.) After you set up activities, you can add them to service orders automatically based on the related service agreement, or you can manually add activities when you add lines to a service order.

You can view the status of service activities in the **Dispatch board** form. You can also reassign activities from one worker to another worker in that form.
