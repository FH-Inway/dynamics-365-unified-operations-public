# Service order item requirements

[!include [banner](../includes/banner.md)]

You can create a service order to track and manage services that you provide to your customers. If you need to reserve specific items for a service order, you can create inventory item requirements for it. An item requirement can be immediately consumed from inventory, or it can initiate a production order for the item.

By using an item requirement instead of an item transaction, you can plan for delivery just before the item is actually used, create a purchase order, include the item in the trade-agreement framework, and include the item requirement in production planning.

Item requirements for service orders are processed through a project. To create an item requirement on a service order, the service order must be attached to a project.

As soon as an item requirement is created for a service order, it can be viewed from **Project** in the individual service order or through the **Sales order** form.

## View an item requirement from a service order

1. Go to **Service management** \> **Service orders** \> **Service orders**.
1. Select **Dispatch**, and then select **Item requirement** to open the **Item requirements** form.
1. Select the **Project** tab, and check the **Service order** field to see the service orders of the item requirement.

## Delete service orders with item requirements

If an item requirement is created on a service order, you cannot delete the service order. You must delete the item requirement before you can delete the service order.

1. Go to **Service management** \> **Service orders** \> **Service orders**.
1. Select **Dispatch**, and then select **Item requirement** to open the **Item requirements** form. This form lists the item requirements that are created on the service order.
1. Select the item requirement to delete, and then select **Delete**.

–or–

1. Go to **Project management and accounting** \> **Projects** \> **All projects**.
1. Open the project that has the service order in which an item requirement is created.
1. In the **Projects** form, in the right pane, select **Item requirements**. The **Item requirements** form lists the item requirements that are associated with the selected project.
1. Select the item requirement to delete, and then select **Delete**.
