View and modify the list of stage reasons for a service order. Use stage reasons to indicate the reason for the status of a service order. For example, you can create a **Canceled** stage that is assigned a reason code of **Canceled by the customer**.

  - Click **Service management** \> **Service orders** \> **Service orders**. Open a service order.

  - In the **Service orders** form, on the **Action Pane**, on the **Dispatch** tab, click **Stage reasons**.

  - On the **Stage reasons** form, click **New** to create a new stage reason code.
