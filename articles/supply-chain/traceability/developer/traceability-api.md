# Traceability API (preview)

[!INCLUDE [preview-banner](~/../shared-content/shared/preview-includes/preview-banner.md)]
<!-- KFM: Preview until further notice -->

This article describes how to integrate the Traceability Add-in for Dynamics 365 Supply Chain Management with external systems through its API.

## Authentication

The platform security token is used to call the Traceability public API. Therefore, you must generate a *Microsoft Entra token* by using your Microsoft Entra application. You must then use the Microsoft Entra token to get the *access token* from the security service.

To obtain an access token, follow these steps:

1. Sign in to the [Azure portal](https://ms.portal.azure.com/).
1. Search for or navigate to the **App registrations** page.
1. Open the [app registration](traceability-install.md) you created for the Traceability app.
1. From the left navigator, select **Overview**. Copy the value shown for **Application (client) ID** to a temporary text file.
1. From the toolbar, select **Endpoints**.
1. The **Endpoints** dialog opens. Copy the value shown for **OAuth 2.0 token endpoint (v2)** to a temporary text file.
1. Fetch a Microsoft Entra token by submitting an HTTP request that has the following properties:

    - **URL** – Use the **OAuth 2.0 token endpoint (v2)** value you found earlier in this procedure.
    - **Method** – GET
    - **Body content** – Submit the body content listed in the following table as form data.

        | Key | Value |
        |--|--|
        | client\_id | {Application (client) ID in Microsoft Azure} |
        | client\_secret | {Client secret value} |
        | grant\_type | client\_credentials |
        | scope | 0cdb527f-a8d1-4bf8-9436-b352c68682b2/.default |

1. You should receive a Microsoft Entra token in response. It should resemble the following example:

    ```json
    {
        "token_type": "Bearer",
        "expires_in": 3599,
        "ext_expires_in": 3599,
        "access_token": "eyJ0eXAiOiJKV1QiLC…OUppUdgPQ"
    }
    ```

1. Use the Microsoft Entra token to generate a bearer token by submitting an HTTP request that has the following properties:

    - **URL** – `https://securityservice.operations365.dynamics.com/token`
    - **Method** – POST
    - **Body content** – Submit the following body content as JSON content:

        ```json
        {
            "grant_type": "client_credentials",
            "client_assertion_type": "aad_app",
            "client_assertion": "{Microsoft Entra token}",
            "scope": "https://traceabilityservice.operations365.dynamics.com/.default",
            "context": "{environmentId}",
            "context_type": "finops-env"
        }
        ```

        Where *{environmentId}* is the environment ID of your Supply Chain Management environment in Lifecycle Services.

1. You should receive an access token in response. You must use this token as a bearer token to call the Traceability API. Here's an example of a response:

    ```json
    {
        "access_token": "{access token}",
        "token_type": "bearer",
        "expires_in": 3600
    }
    ```

## Find the Traceability API URL

To find the URL for accessing your Traceability API, follow the instructions provided in [API endpoint](traceability-configure.md#api-endpoint).

## Available APIs

The following table lists the APIs available for Traceability.

| Path | Method | Description |
|--|--|--|
| /api/environments/{environmentId}/events/PostBatchEvents | Post | Create genealogy node and activity |
| /api/environments/{environmentId}/traces/Query | Post | Query by tracking ID |

Where *{environmentId}* is the environment ID of your Supply Chain Management environment in Lifecycle Services.

The remaining sections provide detailed information about each API.

## Post activity events API

This API lets external systems post activity events to the Traceability service. Activity events include production component assembly and goods receipt in business activities.

- **Path** – `/api/environments/{environmentId}/events/PostBatchEvents`
- **Method** – `POST`

Where *{environmentId}* is the environment ID of your Supply Chain Management environment in Lifecycle Services.
