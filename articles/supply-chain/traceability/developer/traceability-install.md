# Install and update Traceability (preview)

<!-- KFM: Preview until further notice -->

This article describes how to install and upgrade the various components of the Traceability Add-in for Dynamics 365 Supply Chain Management.

## Prerequisites

To use Traceability, your system must meet the following requirements:

- You must be running Microsoft Dynamics 365 Supply Chain Management version 10.0.39 or later.
- If you also want to integrate Traceability with the production floor execution interface, you must be running Microsoft Dynamics 365 Supply Chain Management version 10.0.40 or later.

## Microsoft Azure configuration

### Register a new Microsoft Entra application

1. Sign in to the [Azure portal](https://ms.portal.azure.com/).
1. Search for or navigate to the **App registrations** page.
1. On the toolbar, select **New registration**.
1. Fill out the **Register and application** page and select **Register**. For more information about these settings, see [Quickstart: Register an application with the Microsoft identity platform](/entra/identity-platform/quickstart-register-app?tabs=certificate).
1. Your new app registration opens. On the left navigation pane, select **Overview**. Copy the following values to a temporary text file. You'll need them later.
    - **Application (client) ID**
    - **Directory (tenant) ID**

### Create client secrets for the new Microsoft Entra application

1. In the [Azure portal](https://ms.portal.azure.com/), open the application you registered in the previous section.
1. In the left navigation pane, select **Manage** \> **Certificates & secrets**.
1. On the **Certificates & secrets** page, select **New client secret**.
1. In the **Add a client secret** dialog, enter a description and choose an expiration date for the secret. Then select **Add**.
1. The **Certificates & secrets** page now includes your new secret. Copy the **Value** and **Secret ID** of the secret and store it in a secure location. You'll need these values later. **IMPORTANT:** the **Value** is only displayed once, so you won't be able to retrieve it again after closing this page.

## Install and configure the Traceability app in Power Apps
