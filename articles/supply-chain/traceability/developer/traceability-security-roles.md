The Traceability Add-in for Dynamics 365 Supply Chain Management use Power Platform role *System Administrator* and *Finance and Operations Basic User* for access control. Use this role to grant access to the Traceability app.

Use the [Power Platform admin center](https://admin.powerplatform.microsoft.com) to grant Traceability permissions to the following types of users:

- **Administrator users** – Assign the default *System Administrator*, as provided, to users who need to configure the Traceability app with full access.
- **Business users** – Assign the *Finance and Operations Basic User* role to Business user who only need inquery access.
