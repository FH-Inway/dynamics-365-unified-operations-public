# Traceability app quick start (preview)

[!INCLUDE [preview-banner](~/../shared-content/shared/preview-includes/preview-banner.md)]
<!-- KFM: Preview until further notice -->

This article describes how to verify, import, and remove demo data. It also explains how to use demo data to explore the capabilities of the Traceability app in Power Apps.

## Verify demo data

Usually, demo data is installed automatically when you first install the Traceability Add-in for Dynamics 365 Supply Chain Management.

To check whether demo data is installed on your system, follow these steps.

1. [Open the Traceability app](traceability-app-run.md) in Power Apps.
1. On the left navigation pane, select **Settings** \> **Activity**.
1. Verify that configuration settings shown in the following table are shown on the **Activity** page.

    | Company | Activity Code | Activity Type | Source Activity Code | Source Activity Type | Track or not |
    |--|--|--|--|--|--|
    | USMF | Goods Receipt | Production | Goods Receipt | Production | TRUE |
    | USMF | Consumption | Production | Consumption | Production | TRUE |

    If the configuration settings aren't shown, then you can import the demo data as described in the next section.

## Import demo data

If you'd like to explore Traceability using demo data, but the data isn't available, follow these steps to import it.

1. [Open the Traceability app](traceability-app-run.md) in Power Apps.
1. On the left navigation pane, select **Home** \> **Get started**.
1. In the **Manage environment data** section, on the **Import demo data** tile, select **Import demo data**.
1. Wait until the import process is complete. The process might take several minutes.

## Delete all data

When you're done exploring the demo data, you can remove it from your system, together with all other data that's been collected since you started using Traceability.

> [!WARNING]
> This procedure removes *all* data from the Traceability Add-in for Supply Chain Management, not just the demo data. Be sure you want to delete all data before you proceed.

To delete all data from the Traceability Add-in, follow these steps.

1. [Open the Traceability app](traceability-app-run.md) in Power Apps.
1. On the left navigation pane, select **Home** \> **Get started**.
1. In the **Manage environment data** section, on the **Delete all data** tile, select **Delete all data**.
1. Wait until the import process is complete. This process might take several minutes.

## Demo data model

The demo data describes the components of a manufactured bicycle. The following illustration shows the bill of materials (BOM) structure of the bicycle.

## Explore the demo data

This section shows how to explore the capabilities of the Traceability app using the demo data. Several common scenarios are described.

1. [Open the Traceability app](traceability-app-run.md) in Power Apps.
1. On the left navigation pane, select **Trace** \> **Genealogy trace**.
1. Make a *backwards search*, which lets you enter a unique identifier of a finished good to retrieve its genealogy, activity, and data collection.

    Use the search field to look for a specific serial number of a finished good. For example, you can use the serial number *bike-s0001* or *bike-s0002* to find the genealogy tree of a bike from the demo data.

1. Traceability shows a genealogy tree for the serial number you entered. Now you can do an *activity verification* by following these steps:

    1. Select the node for the bike in the genealogy tree.
    1. Select the **View detail** button for your selected node to open a dialog.
    1. Open the **Activities** tab in the dialog. Activity events are displayed in reverse chronological order. For example, you might see five activities for *Consumption* and one activity for *Goods receipt*.

1. Do a *forward search* to see the higher-level assembly related to a selected genealogy tree node. Follow these steps:

    1. Select the paint-demo node in the genealogy tree.
    1. Select the **Trace** button for your selected node. The app now shows a high-level genealogy list.

1. Try out the *table views*. Until now, you've been working on the **Graphic view** tab. The table views provide another way to view and explore your data. Try the following options:

    - Select **Table view - composition** to do a backward search.
    - Select **Table view â€“ where used** to do a forward search.
