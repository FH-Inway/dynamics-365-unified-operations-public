# Associate a fuel index with a carrier as an accessorial charge

[!include [banner](../../includes/banner.md)]

This guide shows how to create an accessorial assignment, carrier accessorial charge, and accessorial master for fuel surcharge. It also shows how to associate a carrier fuel index with a carrier. A carrier fuel index must already exist before you run this guide (learn more in [Set up a carrier fuel index](set-up-carrier-fuel-index.md)). These setup tasks are typically done by a logistics manager.

## Create an accessorial master

1. Go to **Transportation management** \> **Setup** \> **Rating** \> **Accessorial masters**.
1. Select **New**.
1. In the **Accessorial master** field, type a value.
1. In the **Name** field, type a value.
1. Select **Save**.

## Create a carrier accessorial charge
