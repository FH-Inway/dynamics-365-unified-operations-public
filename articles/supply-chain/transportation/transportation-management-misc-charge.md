# Transportation management miscellaneous charges

[!include [banner](../includes/banner.md)]

As with all miscellaneous charges, transportation-generated charges must be associated with a charge code. Otherwise, they won't be added back to the order as a miscellaneous charge. The **Charges code** determines how the charge is accounted for in relation to the order and order line where it is added.

Go to **Transportation management > Setup > Rating > Miscellaneous charges** to define the qualifying criteria that determine when a specific **Charges code** is applied to a charge.

You should have at least one setup for each relevant **Charges module** setting (*Customer* and *Vendor*) where the **Miscellaneous charge type** is set to *None*. If this is missing, the miscellaneous charge will *not* be added to the order.
