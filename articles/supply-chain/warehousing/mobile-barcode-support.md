# Mobile bar code support

[!include [banner](../includes/banner.md)]

Because Android is an open-source project, any manufacturer of hardware for warehouse bar code scanners can build a device to run the Android operating system. A device is only Android-compatible if it can run apps that are written for the Android execution environment.

However, a hardware vendor can modify and create overlays for the Android version that runs on their hardware. Microsoft can't take any responsibility to ensure that a mobile bar code scanning app for Android is compatible with a manufacturer's bar code scanning hardware and the Android version that runs on it.

The Warehouse Management mobile app has been tested with a selection of Android powered devices for bar code scanning. These tests only cover a sample of the devices that are available on the market.

We recommend that you test the Warehouse mobile scanning app on selected hardware before you decide on the hardware that you want to buy.

For information about how to solve some types of compatibility issues between the Warehouse Management mobile app and your bar code scanner, see [Advanced barcode scanner configuration](warehouse-app-adv-scanner-config.md).
