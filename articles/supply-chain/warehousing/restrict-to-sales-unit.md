# Restrict to sales unit

This article describes the *Restrict to sales unit* functionality and provides an example scenario.


The *Restrict to sales unit* functionality is designed to ensure that products are sold in a specific, predefined unit. This functionality applies exclusively to sales orders. It specifies the exact unit that a product should be sold in. If the reservation of a product on a sales order leads to incomplete sales units, the release of the sales order to the warehouse is blocked. An error message indicates that the sales order can't be processed because of the incomplete sales units.


To configure the *Restrict to sales unit* functionality for a product, follow these steps.

1. Go to **Product information management** \> **Products**.
1. On the **Warehouse** FastTab, in the **Release to warehouse** section, in the **Restrict to unit** field, select *Sales unit*.
1. Select **Save**.


> [!IMPORTANT]
> To configure the *Restrict to sales unit* functionality for a product, follow these steps.

## Example: Releasing a sales order with conversion of units

- Product *item-one* has *Pieces* as the inventory unit.
- The sales unit is *Box*.

1. In the list, select a product to view the product details.
1. Select **Save**.
> The **Unit** field on the **Sell** FastTab of the product details defines the sales unit that the *Restrict to sales unit* functionality uses.
- The **Restrict to unit** field is set to *Sales unit*.
- Product *item-one* has *Pieces* as the inventory unit.
- The **Restrict to unit** field is set to *Sales unit*.
- If the reserved quantity is the full quantity, *10 Pieces*, the sales order is successfully released to the warehouse.

When the sales order is released to the warehouse, the outcome depends on the reserved quantity:
- If the reserved quantity is the full quantity (*10 Pieces*), the sales order is successfully released to the warehouse.
- If the reserved quantity is *7 Pieces*, the result is one full box and almost half of the other box. In this case, the release of the sales order to the warehouse fails, and the customer receives an error message.



> [!NOTE]
> There's an exception to the expected behavior of the *Restrict to sales unit* functionality. If the *Automatic release of sales orders* functionality is enabled, and the **Quantity to release** option is set to *All*, the *Restrict to sales unit* functionality is ignored.
