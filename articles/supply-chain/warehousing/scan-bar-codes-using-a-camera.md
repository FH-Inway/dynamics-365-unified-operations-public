# Scan bar codes using a camera in the Warehouse Management mobile app

[!include [banner](../includes/banner.md)]

This article explains how to set up the Warehouse Management mobile app to scan bar codes using a camera on a mobile device.

## Setup

In the display settings of the Warehouse Management mobile app, you can select if the camera should be used for bar code scanning. If you enable **Use the camera as scanner**, you can use the camera on every input field that has the preferred input mode set to **Scanning**.

To control whether an input field should be scannable, on the **Warehouse app field names** page, set **Preferred input mode** to **Scanning**. When this option is selected, a camera can be used for scanning in the Warehouse Management mobile app. Learn more in [Configure fields for the Warehouse Management mobile app](configure-app-field-names-priorities-warehouse.md).

## Navigation

The camera page will be initiated on each page where the input field has its **Preferred input mode** set to *Scanning*, when you are on the camera page use the following options to navigate:

- Select the back button to go back to the **Task and details** page.
- Select the pencil on the **Task and details** page to go to a page where you can manually enter input.
- Select the camera on the **Task and details** page to go back to the camera page.

On the camera page, when you select the camera button, it will appear dimmed while trying to identify a bar code. If a bar code is not identified within five seconds, the process will time out and the camera button will become available again. You will then be able to try to scan a bar code again.

When you aim the camera at a bar code, a green check mark button indicates that you can scan it. Select the button to scan the code. If more than one bar code is scanned, the app asks you to identify the correct bar code.
