# Warehouse Management mobile app calculator

[!include [banner](../includes/banner.md)]

The Warehouse Management mobile app includes a built-in calculator that provides essential numerical entry and mathematical computation capabilities. It enables workers to perform calculations without leaving their current workflow.

The calculator supports the following features:

- Standard numerical input and real-time calculations.
- Long press the **9** key to enter negative numbers.
- Long press the decimal point (**.**) key to open the arithmetical operators menu.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> The long-press gestures require a press duration of at least half a second. Brief taps don't trigger the enhanced functionality.

## Access the calculator

The workflow automatically shows the calculator when the worker needs it. For example, it appears when workers need to enter values for the following types of fields:

- **Quantity fields**: When entering item quantities during warehouse operations.
- **Number-type inputs**: As defined by the workflow configuration.
- **Measurement values**: When precise numerical input is required.

## Basic input and calculator functionality

The calculator functions as a specialized numerical input tool with an enhanced interface. Workers can enter numbers using the numeric keypad and perform mathematical operations in real-time.

## Arithmetical operators

The calculator provides access to four basic arithmetical operators. To select an operator, follow these steps:

1. Long press the decimal point (**.**) key on the keypad.
1. Select your desired operator (addition (**&plus;**), subtraction (**&minus;**), multiplication (**&times;**), or division (**&divide;**)).

## Enter a negative number

To enter negative numbers in the calculator, follow these steps:

1. Enter the value using the numeric keypad.
1. Long press the **9** key on the keypad to toggle the entered value from positive to negative.
1. Continue with your calculation as normal.

> [!NOTE]
> This gesture only works with the **9** key. It provides quick access to negative values without requiring a separate negative sign button.

## Usage examples

### Enter a quantity value

To enter a numerical value for a quantity field, follow these steps:

1. When the app requires a quantity input, it automatically shows the calculator interface.
1. Enter your desired quantity using the numeric keypad.
1. If you need to convert the value to negative, long press the **9** key to toggle the sign.
1. Confirm the entry to proceed with your workflow.

### Perform a calculation when entering a quantity value

To perform a calculation when entering a quantity, follow these steps:

1. Enter the first number using the numeric keypad.
1. Open the operator menu by long pressing the decimal point (**.**) key.
1. Select your desired operator (addition (**&plus;**), subtraction (**&minus;**), multiplication (**&times;**), or division (**&divide;**)).
1. Enter the second number.
1. Press the equals key to view the result.
1. Confirm the entry to proceed with your workflow.

## Troubleshooting

This section describes common issues and their solutions.

### Long press gestures aren't responding

**Problem**: The long press gesture doesn't activate the enhanced functionality.

**Solution**: Make sure you're holding the button for at least half a second. A brief tap doesn't activate the gesture control.

### The operations menu doesn't appear

**Problem**: The arithmetical operators menu doesn't display when needed.

**Solution**: Verify that you're long pressing the decimal point (**.**) key for at least half a second. Other numbers and function keys don't open the menu.

### A gesture activates unintentionally

**Problem**: Enhanced functionality triggers during normal use.

**Solution**: Adjust your input technique to use brief taps when entering standard numbers. Reserve longer presses only for when you intend to use the enhanced gesture controls.
