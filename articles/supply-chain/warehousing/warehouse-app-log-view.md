# Local Log View page

This article provides a simple guide on how to use the Local Log View page in the Warehouse Mobile App (WMA). The Log View helps users access and manage logs related to app activity. Itâ€™s especially useful when something goes wrong and you need to share details with the development team for troubleshooting.

## What Is Local Log View?

The Local Log View is a page where the app stores logs of its operations, such as login attempts, page navigation, and other actions. If an issue occurs while using the app (for example, during login or navigation), the app automatically saves a log entry here.
These logs can help developers understand what went wrong and fix the issue faster.

## How to Use Local Log View?

When you need to collect logs related to an issue:
- Use the filter option to narrow down logs by time or issue type.
- Use the search bar at the top to find specific log entries.
- Click on a log line to view details such as time, type, and message.
- Once you've selected the relevant logs, click the Save button to extract them.
- Share the saved logs with the development team.
  
## How to Access Log View?

Follow these steps to open the Local Log View page:

1. Click the **Set Up Connection** button.
1. In the Connection Setup pop-up window, select  **Diagnostics**.
1. On the Diagnostics page, click the **Local Log View** tile.
