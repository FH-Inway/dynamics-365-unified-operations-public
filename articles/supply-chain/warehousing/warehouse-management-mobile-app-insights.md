# Warehouse Management mobile app insights

[!include [banner](../includes/banner.md)]

<!--KFM: It's confusing that the settings menu calls this feature "copilot", the main menu calls it "Workload" and the documentation calls it "insights". -->

The Warehouse Management mobile app provides a *workload* page that shows work summaries and AI-generated insights to help warehouse workers better plan their shift. The information shown can include the following details:

- The number of pick and receive work headers or work lines.
- The number of active warehouse mobile app sessions in the warehouse.
- Insights into the available work types.
- The current workload, displayed either as work headers or work lines.
- Details of available work per work type.
- Additional information about available work, described in natural language generated by Copilot.

Workers can use these insights to get an overview of their workday and optimize the way they engage with their daily tasks. Detailed information about available tasks enhances operational efficiency, reduces time spent on information retrieval, and optimizes resource allocation across the warehouse floor.

The workload page offers insights into relevant warehouse operations, such as the number of active warehouse mobile sessions working in the same warehouse. This fosters a more connected and efficient workplace by promoting awareness and coordination among workers.

When workers first open the workload page, they're shown an overview of unstarted tasks scheduled for the current warehouse, together with a natural-language summary generated by Copilot. The following illustration shows how it looks. First, the app shows an overview (left). Workers can then tap the screen to see detailed information about open work by type, which lets them quickly grasp their day's objectives (right).
