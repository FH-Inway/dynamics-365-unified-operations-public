# Warehouse management overview

[!include [banner](../includes/banner.md)]

The Warehouse management module lets you manage warehouse processes in manufacturing, distribution, and retail companies. This module has a wide range of features to support the warehouse facility at an optimal level, at any time. Warehouse management is fully integrated with other business processes such as transportation, manufacturing, quality control, purchase, transfer, sales, and returns.

## Get started

To start working with Warehouse management, you need to complete the setup of the general warehouse parameters to support the business processes of your company.

- Go to the **Warehouse management parameters** page under **Warehouse management** > **Setup** to set up general warehouse parameters.

You must configure components for inbound and outbound warehouse process workflows according to business requirements. The most important components that you must configure are wave templates, work templates, work pools, and location directives.
