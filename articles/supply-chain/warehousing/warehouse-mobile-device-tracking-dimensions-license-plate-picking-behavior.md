# Warehouse mobile device tracking dimensions and license plate picking behavior

One of the design goals of the warehouse mobile device picking flows is to minimize the amount scanning and keying required from the worker. To this end, some fields on the mobile device are either prepopulated value or skipped entirely. This article explains some of these cases. Some behaviors differ based on which warehouse mobile device flow you're using and how your on-hand inventory looks in terms of license plates and tracking dimension combinations.

## Picking and target license plates

When a worker picks an item, the system moves that inventory to the *user* location. The user location must always be license plate tracked. The behavior of the system can be influenced by several things. For example, whether the picking location license plate tracked, whether the used mobile device menu item has the **Generate license plate** and/or **Override target license plate** options enabled, and so on. After a target license plate is chosen, it usually can't be changed and will continue to be used for all the subsequent pick work lines from the same work record. The entered target license plate doesn't need to exist in the system before it's used. If the relevant record didn't exist before, then the system creates it. An existing license plate can be used as a target license plate provided it doesn't have any on-hand inventory on it, and you can't have the same license plate with on-hand inventory at two different warehouse locations.

If a worker picks from a location that isn't license plate tracked, then the worker is asked to enter the target license plate. This target license plate can also be automatically generated by the system provided the mobile device menu item being used has the **Generate license plate** option enabled. In that case, the worker is prompted to confirm the generated license plate or to choose a new one. The **Override target license plate** setting isn't used in this case.

If a worker picks from a location that is license plate tracked, then the behavior depends on how much of the total license plate quantity is picked.

- If the worker picks the full quantity from the license plate, then that license plate is automatically used as the target, and the worker won't be asked to enter or confirm the target license plate. This behavior can be changed by the **Override target license plate** setting on the mobile device menu item. If that setting is enabled, then the worker is given the opportunity to change the target license plate. The **Generate license plate** setting isn't used in this case.
- If the worker should only pick part of quantity from the license plate, then a different target license plate is needed. This case is basically the same as the one when picking is performed from a location that isn't license plate tracked.

## Tracking dimensions (batch number and serial number)

When an item has tracking dimensions enabled (batch number or serial number), the system usually needs to know exactly which batch or serial number is picked, regardless of the reservation hierarchy used. For batch numbers, this is always true, but for serial numbers, it can depend on the **Capture serial number** setting on the item's **Tracking dimension group**. If **Capture serial number** is set to *Picking*, the worker must use the mobile device to capture the serial number during the picking process, even though blank receipt and issue are allowed. If **Capture serial number** is set to *Packing*, the worker captures the serial number later, during the packing process, instead of when picking. If the field is set to *None*, which is the default setting, the system will behave in the standard way, which is described in the next paragraph. A special case occurs when **Active in sales process** is enabled. In this case, serial numbers aren't saved in the inventory transactions, but in a separate table, but that behavior is similar to the *Picking* and *Packing* ones described previously.

The standard tracking behavior described in this paragraph can't be changed using configuration settings. It's the same for both batch and serial numbers (provided the serial number doesn't have **Active in sales process** enabled and **Capture serial number** is set to *None*). If the whole quantity from a location or license plate is picked, then the worker isn't asked to enter batch or serial numbers, regardless of how many batch or serial numbers are available on-hand. As mentioned previously, this behavior is designed to minimize the number of interactions required from the worker on the mobile device. In case the worker should only pick part of the quantity available at a location or license plate, then the worker is prompted to enter each picked batch and/or serial number because the system can't otherwise know which of the available numbers were picked.
