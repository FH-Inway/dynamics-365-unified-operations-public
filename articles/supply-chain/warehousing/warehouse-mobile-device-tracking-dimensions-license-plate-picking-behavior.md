# Warehouse mobile device tracking dimensions and license plate picking behavior

One of the ideas behind the Warehouse mobile device picking flows is to reduce the number of scans or typing required of the worker. Because of that, some fields on the mobile device might get pre-populated value or be entirely skipped.

This article will try to explain some of these cases.

## Picking and target license plates

Whenever an item is picked as part of the warehouse work pick line, the inventory is moved to the user location. The user location must always be license plate tracked. The behavior of the system can be influenced by several things. For example, is the picking location licence plate tracked, does the used mobile device menu item have **Generate license plate** or **Override target license plate** enabled, etc. Once the target license plate has been chosen, in general it cannot be changed and will continue to be used for all the subsequent pick work lines inside the same work. The entered target license plate doesn't need to exists in the system before it is used here. If the relevant record didn't exist before, then it will be created by the system. An existing license plate can be used as a target license plate, but it is a requirement that it doesn't have any on-hand inventory on it, as it is not allowed to have the same license plate with on-hand inventory on two different warehouse locations.

If the picking is performed from a location that is not license plate tracked, then the user will be asked to enter the target license plate. This target license plate can also be automatically generated by the system if the used mobile device menu item has **Generate license plate** enabled. In that case, the user will be asked to confirm the target license plate, but it can still be changed by the user. The **Override target license plate** setting is not used in this case.

If the picking is performed from a location that is license plate tracked, then the behavior depens how much of the total license plate quantity is picked.
If all of the quantity from the license plate is picked, than that license plate will automatically be used as the target license plate, and the user will not be asked to neither enter nor confirm the target license plate. This behavior can be changed by the **Override target license plate** setting on the used mobile device menu item. If that setting is enabled, then the user will be given the opportunity to change the target license plate. The **Generate license plate** setting is not used in this case.
If only a part of the quantity from the license plate is picked, then a different target license plate is needed. This case is the basically the same as the one when the picking is performed from a location that is not license plate tracked.
